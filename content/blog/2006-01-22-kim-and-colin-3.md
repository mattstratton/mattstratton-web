This morning I hung out with and Tom and their son, [Colin][1]. I took a bunch of pictures &#8211; I haven&#8217;t gone through them all yet, but I did upload a couple to Flickr. I like this one a lot &#8211; I especially like the difference in expression on mother and baby. Too funny. Plus, it&#8217;s a pretty pictures of Kim, and a cute one of Colin.
