Based upon an IM conversation I just had with , I&#8217;ve decided to modify my &#8220;I include a photo in all blog posts&#8221; thing.

First of all, I&#8217;ve not been very good about that. So the first modification will be to actually do it.

Secondly, I will make sure I blog at least once a day &#8211; even if the post is just the photo, and nothing interesting happened to me. So I kind of already did a photo post today, however, it was more about &#8220;help me fix this photo&#8221;, so it doesn&#8217;t count.

Instead, we shall count this one. It&#8217;s some wine holding apparatus from a winery in Michigan. I was channeling my inner [Joeycat][1] when I took this.
