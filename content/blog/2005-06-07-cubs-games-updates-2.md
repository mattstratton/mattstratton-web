Not that any of you care (this is mostly just to make hate me even more), but my Cubs attendences have changed.

I will be going to see the game tonight v. Toronto. Then Friday v. Red Sox. No longer going on Monday v. Marlins (bye bye awesome seats!), but going on Tuesday with Brian and Tracy. Then Friday &#8211; Sat &#8211; Sun at the Yankees.
