A very talented actor, the lovely Kelly Belmont, will be appearing on WTTW&#8217;s &#8220;Check Please&#8221; this Friday, Jan 16 at 8 PM.

According to Kelly:

_Just in case any of you are like me&#8230;no life, and would much rather prefer to stay in on a Friday night watching PBS than actually being social, be sure to check out WTTW Channel 11 at 8pm this Friday, January 16th. Yours truly will be a featured reviewer on Check, Please. If you&#8217;re not familiar with the show, it is a 1/2 hour show that has 3 regular people (like me!) reviewing their favorite Chicago restaurants. I chose Superdawg, the greatest hot dog place ever to grace the Northwest side. Oh, and if you are one of the lucky ones who actually has plans for Friday night, you can catch it Saturday afternoon or Sunday night, too.</p> 

**Disclaimer &#8212; If you DO watch my episode, just know that the wine was free-flowing during the hour and a half taping, so I think I may have been pretty obnoxious. We shall see.</i>

Kelly has appeared in all of GTF&#8217;s films, including _Dancing With Gaia_, _Inventing: Music_, and _Inventing: Stephen_. We love her to pieces.
