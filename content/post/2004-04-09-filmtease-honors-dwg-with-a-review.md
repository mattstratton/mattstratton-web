Those cats over at [Filmtease][1] have posted a review of the _[Dancing With Gaia][2]_ teaser.

Thanks to Brian, Steve, and Trapper for taking notice of our film trailer, and for this line in particular &#8211; &#8220;Whenever you can work poop in a trailer, and its not poorly edited over another word, that is fun.&#8221;
