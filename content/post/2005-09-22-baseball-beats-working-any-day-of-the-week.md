Took the day off of work to head up to Milwaukee with my boss and another work dude for the Cubs game.

It was a quick one &#8211; game time was 2 hours and 19 minutes. Cubs won 3-0. Miller Park is pretty nice, but it was weird watching baseball &#8220;inside&#8221;.

Two highlights:

When walking in, I overheard some guy say &#8220;There&#8217;s a guy who&#8217;s even fatter than we are, and look at the hot girl with him!&#8221;

On the jumbotron: &#8220;The Brewers welcome K UEGER INDUSTRIAL SMOOTHING&#8221;
