Today we went to Universal Studios. It was pretty windy, so when the wind picked up it was cold! But as long as the wind wasn&#8217;t blowing, it was plenty warm in the sun. 

We did all the rides (well most of them) and I think our favorite was the Shrek 3-D show (the Terminator one was cool, but definitely dated in comparison). I got picked as a volunteer (read: &#8220;Carrie raised my hand for me&#8221;) for the Disaster show, and got to be green-screened flying through the air. 

We&#8217;re trying to figure out what we&#8217;ll be doing for the rest of the trip &#8211; it&#8217;s going to be a little chilly, so the beach (and water parks, probably) are out. We might go to Islands of Adventure tomorrow and Typhoon Lagoon on Monday, or maybe do something more indoorsy tomorrow and Islands of Adventure on Monday.

Oh, and we went to IHOP for breakfast today :)
