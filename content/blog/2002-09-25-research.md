OK, so I&#8217;m working on a screenplay about single (and not necessarily single) women.

My friend Kathy told me she&#8217;d like to see a story about the &#8220;plight&#8221; of being a single woman these days. I really don&#8217;t know what kind of &#8220;plight&#8221; she&#8217;s talking about.

But all you womenfolks out there&#8230;what kinds of issues do you face as a woman? What interesting aspects to being a single woman do you think I am unaware of, and that I should take into consideration with these characters?
