From the book <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=trj9_AVpXb8C&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=%22why+are+we+jets+fans%3F%22&source=web&ots=s3qYN5nIHV&sig=i11sJp49lRZ2kKAgLm3TQgSTPb8&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result" target="_blank"><em>True Believers</em></a> by Joe Queenan.

_A friend tells a story about taking his ten-year-old son to a Jets game. The game was being played during a driving rain on a freezing cold day, and the Jets lost by twenty points to a team they were supposed to beat. As they headed toward the exits, the boy looked up, with tears in his eyes, and asked, &#8220;Dad, why are we Jets fans?&#8221;_
