Carrie and I arrived in Ft. Lauderdale late last night. It&#8217;s gorgeous here&#8230;sorry to all of you Chicago folks dealing with the 15 degree temps and 2-4 inches of snow!

Something strange &#8211; looking at my logs, I can see that this blog is getting hits from <a href="https://www.sharepointjoel.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Joel Oleson&#8217;s blog</a> &#8211; this got me really excited, as I am a huge fan of Joel&#8217;s. However, I cannot figure out, for the life of me, where these hits are coming from &#8211; they&#8217;re supposedly referrers from the default.aspx, but I can&#8217;t find any links back to me on that page. Very bizarre.

Today is the day that Cubs regular season tickets go on sale; the virtual waiting room opens in about 15 minutes. So I&#8217;ll be spending the first morning of our vacation angling for Opening Day tickets. I can also tell it&#8217;s that time of year, as I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of hits from the following Google searches:

<p style="padding-left: 30px; ">
  <em>&#8220;multiple tabs for cubs virtual waiting room&#8221;<br /> &#8220;how to get past virtual waiting room&#8221; <br /> &#8220;virtual waiting room multiple windows&#8221; <br /> &#8220;how does the cubs virtual waiting room work&#8221; </em>
</p>

So wish me luck! Also, bear in mind that for the rest of the weekend, I probably won&#8217;t be online too often. I might blog between now and Tuesday, and maybe not&#8230;depends on our schedule. We&#8217;re mostly hoping to be enjoying the fantastic weather and sun. I also probably won&#8217;t be terribly active on <a href="https://twitter.com/mattstratton" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, but you never know. Have a great weekend, everyon!
