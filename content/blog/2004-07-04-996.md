So my LJ activities are severely curtailed by the fact that LJ is blocked at B1. But that&#8217;s okay I suppose.

Updateville&#8230;

Nothing too interesting to report. I&#8217;ve been talking to this girl who sent me a message on that dating site&#8230;she seems cute enough, and kind of funny, but I don&#8217;t see anything happening with it. She&#8217;s a rabid Sox fan (which doesn&#8217;t bother me, except that she&#8217;s one of the &#8220;Cubs suck&#8221; Sox fans, which I just dislike in general), she has cats, and she thinks both Tom Jones and bowling are lame. (They are lame, but they are also fun)

Eh. I&#8217;m not going to worry too much about it. I&#8217;m just having fun with my friends these days and having a good time. The quest for the Girl Who Doesn&#8217;t Annoy Mugsy is a lower priority.
