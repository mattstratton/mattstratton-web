So the Cubs/Marlins game is on ESPN tonight. Now, I always hate watching baseball* on ESPN. But a fine example was when it was commented &#8220;by the way, Andy Pettitte is currently pitching a no-hitter&#8221;.

A minute or two later, what do I see on the crawl? &#8220;Pettitte&#8217;s no-hitter broken up by a home run.&#8221;

What do they teach those people at ESPN school? YOU DON&#8217;T COMMENT ON A NO-NO IN PROGRESS.

Dumbasses.

On another note, what a freakin&#8217; game here. It was Game 6 in reverse &#8211; Cubs go into the bottom of the 8th down 3-0, getting completely shut down&#8230;and they proceed to score 6 runs.

It&#8217;s all up to Dempster now.
