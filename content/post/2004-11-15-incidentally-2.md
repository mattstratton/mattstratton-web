In my friend&#8217;s journal post, she neglects to mention the things she said to me threatening her own life.

This is what she said:

_As the day went on I got a bit peeved that none of my friends had returned phone calls or emails. I had no one to talk to, so I started an IM conversation with Matt. Matt felt compelled to intervene, so he called 911 (I&#8217;m sure out of the goodness of his heart, having NO IDEA what the result would be, but he violated a trust in assuming I couldn&#8217;t take care of myself.)
  
_ 
  
So to all the people who read her journal who also know me, think I over-reacted and am an asshole for putting her through an awful ordeal.

I am not going to comment in her journal. But if you happen to be someone who knows the whole story here, and you hear any of these people talking about it, do me a favor and explain the real story. Thank you.
