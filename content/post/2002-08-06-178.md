Well, the Windy City Lindy Exchange is coming up!

This weekend, Chicago will be over-run by swing dancers from around the country. It&#8217;s madness I tell you, madness!

It&#8217;s going to make my weekend nutty&#8230;and it was nutty already!

I&#8217;ve got five people staying with me for the weekend &#8211;

**Amy from Atlanta**

**Dallas from Columbus**
  
![Dallas is drunk!][1]

**Eli from NYC**
  
![Eli is floral!][2]

**Ronni and Steve from St. Louis**
  
![Steve and Ronni are sexy!][3]

It&#8217;s gonna be madness, sheer madness.

Friday night I&#8217;m having a small cocktail party before the main dance&#8230;which I will not be going to.

Saturday morning, I have to be at the editing suite by 7 AM. Then, we have the Micetro at Beat Kitchen at 3. After that, it&#8217;s dancing to John Burnett at the Hilton Chicago, and then Late Night at Studio X.

Sunday morning, back to editing at 7 AM. Dallas and I have a [GTF][4] meeting in the afternoon, and then there is no way we are gonna miss Lesley Byers and the Jazz Cats at the Willowbrook Ballroom that night.
