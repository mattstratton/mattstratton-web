Happy berfday to my favorite Jersey girl, <a href="https://jodiemim.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">Joeycat</a>!

Got no time for the corner boys
  
Down in the street makin&#8217; all that noise
  
Don&#8217;t want no whores on Eighth Avenue
  
Cause tonight I&#8217;m gonna be with you

Cause tonight I&#8217;m gonna take that ride
  
Across the river to the Jersey side
  
Take my baby to the carnival
  
And I&#8217;ll take you on all the rides

Sing sha la la la la la sha la la la.

Down the shore everything&#8217;s all right
  
You&#8217;re with your baby on a Saturday night
  
Don&#8217;t you know that all my dreams come true
  
When I&#8217;m walkin&#8217; down the street with you

Sing sha la la la la la sha la la la.

You know she thrills me with all her charms
  
When i&#8217;m wrapped up in my baby&#8217;s arms
  
My little angel gives me everything
  
I know someday that she&#8217;ll wear my ring

So don&#8217;t bother me cause I got no time
  
I&#8217;m on my way to see that girl of mine
  
Nothin&#8217; else matters in this whole wide world
  
When you&#8217;re in love with a Jersey girl
