The showing of Inventing: Music at the Chicago International REEL Shorts Festival was pretty good.

Didn&#8217;t have as big of an audience as I&#8217;d been expecting (I think I got spoiled at Rochester). I would say there were probably about 30 or so people in the audience. Of course, about 2/3 of them were there for I:M, so that was cool. The other shorts were pretty good &#8211; a couple were a real lot of fun.

It was interesting to see who showed up. Some real surprises &#8211; my old roommate Susanna was there, which I thought was nice. One guy from work was there as well, with his wife (who coincidentally, I worked with at Allstate). It meant a lot to me to see friends and people close to me willing to come out and be supportive. Unfortunately my parents couldn&#8217;t make it, as they are out of town on vacation. I guess maybe it might not seem like a big deal to have people come and watch a movie you made that they might have already seen, but it was really touching to see people willing to take an hour and half out of their Sunday to &#8220;show the flag&#8221; so to speak. I hope they enjoyed it.

Afterwards, a bunch of us went to My Pi for pizza and beers, and then Dallas headed home. , Ryan, and I went back to the 3 Penny to see _Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_, which I thought was a completely fun movie and would recommend, except that lately it seems that every time I recommend a movie, my friends go to see it and hate it. So I&#8217;m not going to recommend it. See it on your own free will :)
