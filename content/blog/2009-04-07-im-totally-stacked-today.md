I&#8217;ve been threatening to write about cloud computing on this blog for a long time. But I haven&#8217;t gotten around to it. And it just figures that my first cloud-related blog post wouldn&#8217;t be here, but on another blog.

Please check out <a href="https://stackedblog.com/2009/04/07/the-big-switch-by-nicholas-carr/" target="_blank">my review</a> of _The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google_ by Nicholas Carr over at <a href="https://stackedblog.com" target="_blank">Stacked</a>. As Chrstina pointed out, I definitely procrastinated on this one, but I am pretty pleased with how it turned out. If for some reason you&#8217;d like me to write a guest post for YOUR blog on a topic such as cloud computing (or photography&#8230;or unicorns), either leave me a comment here or email me at [matt [dot] stratton [at] gmail [dot] com][1]
