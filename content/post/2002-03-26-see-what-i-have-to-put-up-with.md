For those of you wanting to know how to have a good professional relationship with your writing partner&#8230;

**Matt:** I didn&#8217;t really realize it until yesterday with that email
  
**Matt:** that see, YOU know I am an idiot.
  
**Matt:** she doesnt&#8217; know that
  
**Matt:** I am an authority figure
  
**Matt:** I am IN CHARGE
  
**Matt:** and I generally sound like I know what I am talking about
  
**Dallas:** I know you&#8217;re an idiot.
  
**Dallas:** That&#8217;s one of my &#8220;secret&#8221; jobs on the film&#8211;
  
**Dallas:** to be the ONE guy who knows that you&#8217;re an idiot.
