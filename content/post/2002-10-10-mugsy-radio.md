OK, I set up QuickTime Streaming Server on my iMac at home&#8230;so if you wanna listen to some of my music, you can. Probably doesn&#8217;t work too well through firewalls. And I probably will shut the streaming down when I&#8217;m doing editing. And don&#8217;t publicize this, because it&#8217;s probably illegal.
