1. On your current playlist, hit shuffle and pick the first thirty-five songs on the list (no matter how cheesy or embarrassing). (But I&#8217;m only doing 25, cause I&#8217;m lazy)
   
2. Write down a line of the song. Try to avoid putting the song title in the line.
   
3. Have your friends comment and see if they know the songs. (NO CHEATING!)
  
4. When someone guesses correctly, strike out the line and list the correct name of the song next to it. (Don&#8217;t strike out the line until the song&#8217;s ARTIST and NAME have both been guessed correctly!)
