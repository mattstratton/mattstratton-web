I just watched &#8220;Drawn Together&#8221; for the first time.

For those of you who don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s the so-called &#8220;reality&#8221; show on Comedy Central with the oh-so-clever twist &#8211; the participants are ANIMATED.

I thought it had its moments, but overall was pretty weak. It smacked of CC trying to get on the Adult Swim bandwagon, but missing the boat because they&#8217;re too used to swimming in Crank Yankers waters.

I&#8217;ll give it another chance though. It had hot animated GOGA, so I really can&#8217;t complain.
