So I had a two hour long interview at Bank One today.

I think it went really well. Everyone I interviewed with seemed to like me, and more than one of them made comments to the effect of &#8220;you seem to be a good fit for this position&#8221;.

According to the recruiter, I should hear something &#8220;late tomorrow morning&#8221;. Since Onward needed an answer today, I accepted their offer, and I&#8217;ll just decline it if I get the Bank One gig.
