Last night Carrie and I, along with [**scrapplequeen**][1], Kevin, Lou, Julee, Stacey, Ray, Alexis, and Tommy, went to see Colin Hay perform at the Black Orchid.

I&#8217;d not seen Mr. Hay in concert before, although it seems like everyone else I know has seen him a bajillion times. I&#8217;m so glad we got to go. It was nice, small venue, and very intimate. Plus, since Tommy got there totally early, he managed to &#8220;reserve&#8221; a table for the ten of us (about 75 of the people at the show didn&#8217;t have somewhere to sit and had to stand &#8211; but that wasn&#8217;t us, thanks to Mr. P, Ray, and Alexis!)

The opening act was Ralph Covert, who is apparently the host of a local kids show called &#8220;Ralph&#8217;s World&#8221;. He was pretty good &#8211; Carrie and I both agreed that he had a very Beeyachski feel to him (especially the song about &#8220;Your Ex-Girlfriend&#8221;) &#8211; but you could feel the kids&#8217; singer in him, with all the sing-alongs he did.

Colin Hay was amazing. The music was fantastic, although I&#8217;d say only about 50% of the show was music, the rest being hilarious stories and patter (&#8220;I like playing the songs&#8221;, he said at one point. &#8220;They break up the stories a little bit.&#8221;).

(Random sidenote &#8211; did I punctuate that last sentence properly?)

Today I went to the dentist to get some fillings done and, so I thought, get some bonding on one of my front teeth. As it happens, the only work done was the fillings (which were pretty hairy). I am going to go in a week from Monday to have him do the bonding on my front tooth (it&#8217;s a little recessed, so he&#8217;s going to make it match the one on the other side. This way I won&#8217;t look like there&#8217;s a gap in my smile in wedding photos). I also am hitting the Aquafresh Whitener Trays hard-core, per my dentist&#8217;s recommendation.

Wedding stuff is coming along. Still a few invitations outstanding, but we&#8217;re almost there. Trying to work out exactly what version for Carrie&#8217;s first dance. She and her dad are going to take a dance lesson with Big City, so my mom and I decided we can&#8217;t be shown up, so we&#8217;re going to take a lesson as well.

As we come into the last few weeks of this wedding thing, it&#8217;s definitely getting somewhat stressful. Mostly just because of all the &#8220;little things&#8221; that still have to be done. Also, since our wedding party is so friggin&#8217; ginormous, there&#8217;s a lot of people to &#8220;wrangle&#8221; &#8211; so I do want to thank those folks who have stepped up and made my life easier in this regard. It&#8217;s definitely a weird place to be &#8211; supposedly this is a big, special event for you and your soon to be wife, but it seems that you spend most of your time trying to make other people&#8217;s lives easier and not offend them. At the end of the day, however, it always works out.
