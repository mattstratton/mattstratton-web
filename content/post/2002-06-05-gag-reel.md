So on Sunday, before we wrapped, we fucked around and put together some fake interviews with the crew.

Dallas and I cut them together into a gag reel we showed at the wrap party.

You can check it out if you want. It&#8217;s an about 20 MB non-streaming QuickTime movie. The audio mix isn&#8217;t perfect, and there&#8217;s some loud profanity, so be warned.
