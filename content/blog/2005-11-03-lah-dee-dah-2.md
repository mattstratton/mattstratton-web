Hanging in Minneapolis right now. Surfing teh intarwebs from a local lesbian coffee shop (I&#8217;ve been here for about four and a half hours now, but I figure I&#8217;ve earned my wifi by consuming three double mochas, a muffin, and a sandwich).

Last night Emmysue and I went to the Mall of America to engage in some [ironic tourism][1]. Then we had good sushi. And listened to jazz at [the Dakota][2]. Fun.

Tonight we&#8217;ll be having snarky conversation with some of her friends and playing Trivial Pursuit.

I will be back home on Saturday.
