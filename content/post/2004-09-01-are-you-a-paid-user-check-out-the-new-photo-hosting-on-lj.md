Those marvelous LJ folks have given us [a photo hosting site][1]. There might be a little lag getting your account ready, but once you&#8217;re set up you should be able to upload your pictures. They strongly encourage any paid member who is using the photo hosting service to join the community and give feedback & suggestions.

I just tried it&#8230;I am getting a &#8220;No disk space remaining for your account&#8221; error, but maybe that&#8217;s part of the &#8220;lag&#8221;. I&#8217;ll try again tomorrow.
