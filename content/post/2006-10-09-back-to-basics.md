So as you all know, Carrie just finished up her Swing I class with [Big City Swing][1]. She&#8217;s doing very well.

I told her that after she did Swing I, I would take all the dance classes with her. So tonight we started Swing II. 

Man, I suck. I am soooo sloppy. Tonight was a reminder of seven plus years of bad, BAD habits (it&#8217;s been at least that long since the last time I took a six-count class). My rock step is huge and sloppy. At least I have something to work on though.

It was fun taking a class from [Julee][2] &#8211; the last time I took anything from her was a Lindy I workshop at Logan Square that she taught with Howard back in, um, 1999, I think? (Kristi can confirm or deny the year, since she took it with me)

But at least it will be easier to practice with Carrie now, since I&#8217;ll know what exactly she&#8217;s been learning each week. 

And all you old geezers &#8211; we need to get Fizz started at the old, sad bastard time so that Carrie can get more practice &#8211; we can&#8217;t be going out so late. So let&#8217;s make that happen, m&#8217;kay?
