I hate hate HATE it when the Cubs games are on ESPN (even more than I hate it when they are on Fox).

The ESPN guys don&#8217;t know shit about the Cubs. Joe Morgan keeps saying that Dusty is an &#8220;aggressive manager&#8221;. Yeah, right. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of Len and Bob, but I&#8217;d much rather hear them call the game than these jackasses. Not to mention the fact that since the Cardinals are the #1 team, they clearly are calling in favor of them. So even though the Cubs are the home team, it&#8217;s like watching them be away.

And while I&#8217;m on the subject&#8230;why are Sunday games night games now? Seriously. Sunday games should be in the afternoon. That&#8217;s what Sunday afternoons are FOR &#8211; they are for watching baseball.
