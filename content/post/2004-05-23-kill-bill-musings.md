Saw _Kill Bill Vol. 2_ last night, and I&#8217;ve got some questions.

Actually, it&#8217;s really only one question.

Why did The Bride actually kill Bill?

I mean, besides the fact that all the promo for the film told us she would (&#8220;In 2003 Uma Thurman will KILL BILL&#8221;).

I guess the way I read her character is one out to avenge her daughter&#8217;s murder, not the attempt on her own life. I think that if Beatrix had known B.B. was still alive, she certainly wouldn&#8217;t have been as bloodthirsty going after the other DiVAS.

So once she knows B.B. is still alive, why kill Bill? Why put herself into a position in which she (the mother again) can be harmed? Why allow the potential to be separated again?

I&#8217;m curious to what the rest of you think.
