Went to Game 3 last night.

When I was walking up Clark Street with Partytom, it hit me.

&#8220;Holy shit,&#8221; I said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to a playoff game at Wrigley Field.&#8221;

And what a game it was. Mark Prior is just amazing. This series so far is a textbook case of the old adage &#8220;good pitching beats good hitting.&#8221; Chipper Jones played like a AAA player last night; when he would manage to get a piece of Prior&#8217;s pitch, it was always an easy little hit. The powerhouse of Atlanta is hitting what, .091 in this series?

Offensively, my boys are still floundering though. They&#8217;re getting lucky with a lot of poor fielding by the Braves (Four errors last night. Four.) and they&#8217;re leaving WAY too many men on base. But still some really great things to see.

Right now the series is 2-1 Cubs. Game 4 is today at the Friendly Confines, with Clement &#8211; and it looks like Cox is going to use Ortiz only three days of rest. This could be a big game. And I&#8217;ll be there, sitting in the bleachers. I can only imagine what Wrigleyville will be like if they win today.

Insanity.
