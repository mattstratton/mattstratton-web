Everyone needs to check out [Brian Crane&#8217;s][1] new tracks up on MP3.com.

And make sure you download &#8217;em and not stream &#8217;em&#8230;he doesn&#8217;t get chart cred except for downloads.

Brian is my composer friend who also scores all of our films&#8230;because he&#8217;s a rockstar. If you dig on electronica, give &#8217;em a listen.
