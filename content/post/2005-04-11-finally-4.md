Someone has come up with something that will make it so I don&#8217;t have to look at all you guys&#8217;s goofball LJ styles.

As posted in :

_For those who use Firefox and has the [GreaseMonkey][1] extension installed, I wrote this for YOU:</p> 

[My LJ Style][2]

This will add &#8220;?style=mine&#8221; to the URL of everybody&#8217;s livejournals and communities. Plus, it will add it to all LJ links in the page, too.

If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with GreaseMonkey, it&#8217;s a Firefox extension that allows you to automatically run Javascript code for any or all page. Kinda like a bookmarklet, only more convenient.</i>
