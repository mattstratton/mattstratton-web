Congrats (if that&#8217;s the right word, and it really isn&#8217;t) to Red Sox fans <span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://the-cook.livejournal.com/"><strong>the_cook</strong></a></span> and <span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://swingchickie.livejournal.com/"><strong>swingchickie</strong></a></span>.

Deepest condolences to Yanks fans <span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://swingfeline.livejournal.com/"><strong>swingfeline</strong></a></span> and <span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://jervo.livejournal.com/"><strong>jervo</strong></a></span>.

Smug glance to <span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://jodiemim.livejournal.com/"><strong>jodiemim</strong></a></span>.

Given my distate for the Yankees, I&#8217;m happy to see them lose. But it&#8217;s a bittersweet victory to me &#8211; I really wanted to see my boys in blue in the Series before the BoSox. Because the only good thing I can say about them is that they seem to universally live to make the Yankees look like buffoons.

And that is about all I&#8217;ll say about the postseason. Oh, that and the fact that I really don&#8217;t care who wins the NL, but that I hope the Sox beat them. Because the two teams in contention are teams I hate even more than the Yankees.
