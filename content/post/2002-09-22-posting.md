Wow, that has a double meaning&#8230;I didn&#8217;t mean it like &#8220;I am posting stuff to LJ&#8221;, but &#8220;I am working on post-production.&#8221;

I&#8217;m easily amused when I haven&#8217;t had enough sleep.

Yesterday I shot a video for my friend [Kitty][1]. She&#8217;s a singer-songwriter entering a contest that 103.5 is having.

We shot a music video for her song, &#8220;Allowed&#8221;. It has to be sent off on Monday, so I am spending the day today editing the video together. And so far, so good! I&#8217;m really happy with a lot of the footage we shot. Plus, I&#8217;ve been amazing myself with my sync abilities; I guess all the time of watching Andrew has paid off.

Whoops! My export just finished. Back to work.
