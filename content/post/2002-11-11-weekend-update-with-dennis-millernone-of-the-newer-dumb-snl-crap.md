Actually, this has nothing to do with Dennis Miller. But I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of SNL reruns lately, and have decided that Weekend Update has sucked rocks since Dennis left. The only ray of sunshine was occassionally provided by Norm McDonald, but nobody&#8217;s been consistenly good post-Dennis.

Anyway.

Friday night went to happy hour. I haven&#8217;t been out in a while, so I was glad that a lot of my friends were there; it was a good time. Went out afterwards with Sarah, Chris, Jayson, Evin, and Melissa. Had some cocktails and watched Jayson be drunk. Good times, good times.

Saturday I moved the last of my stuff. The futon has to be moved next weekend, but that&#8217;s going to the studio, so no biggie. My room is full of junk right now; I really need to go through it all. There&#8217;s no free floor space :)

Saturday night I worked on the [DWG][1] interviews, and then went to Studio X with Sarah and Chris. Played a little chess, and talked to DJ Larkin from San Fran (I haven&#8217;t seen him since the Boston Exchange about a year and a half ago&#8230;and I actually enjoyed talking to him on Saturday. I was additionally not disgusted by his lack of style).

Sunday I spent doing some writing and then went to see Big City Swing perform at Dance Chicago. They were rockstars. I think Trapper and Cherie are the only two BCS kids who read my LJ, so I&#8217;ll shout out to them, but the shouts are transitive to the whole troupe. They swung out with their thungs out.

Had Mexican food after Dance Chicago, and then watched a heavily edited TBS version of _Demolition Man_ with Sarah and Chris. Maybe it was the editing, but I didn&#8217;t really enjoy it. Chris said they cut out a lot of the big fights, which made some of it not make much sense. Wesley Snipes was pretty good though.
