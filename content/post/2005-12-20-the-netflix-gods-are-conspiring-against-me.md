So, due to various sick feelings, I am working from home today.

I went to get the mail, and there were new red envelopes in there. Hooray!

I was very excited, because I knew that one of them was a DVD I&#8217;d been wanting to see for a while (_A Wrinkle In Time_), and figured this afternoon would be a great time to curl up and check it out.

I tore open the envelope, pulled out the disc, and prepared to insert it into the DVD player&#8230;

&#8230;and discovered a large crack down the middle.

The DVD is broken.

It will not play.

I now have to wait for Netflix to send me a new one.

I am sad.
