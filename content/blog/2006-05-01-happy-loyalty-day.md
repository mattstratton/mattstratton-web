I&#8217;m very bored.

On Friday afternoon, I gave my laptop to our desktop services guy to have it re-imaged.

Well, turns out I forgot to tell him my password, so he couldn&#8217;t get my Lotus Notes stuff off of it. Long story short, he couldn&#8217;t start rebuilding it until this morning.

So I went to my boss this morning, intending to take the day off. I started by saying &#8220;Well, apparently I don&#8217;t have a laptop until this afternoon&#8230;&#8221;

Before I could finish with &#8220;&#8230;so I&#8217;m going home,&#8221; my boss handed me a Dell laptop from his bag.

&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what good this will do,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I won&#8217;t be able to get onto email or have any of my data.&#8221;

&#8220;Yeah, but you can still surf the Web,&#8221; my boss said.

I took the laptop from him, thinking &#8220;yeah, I could do that at HOME, too&#8230;&#8221;
