So a few years ago, I went on a couple of dates with a really nice girl named Ellie. This was back in Oct/Nov of 2001.

Ellie was super sweet and cute. may remember me telling her that I went on a date with a &#8220;Shana lookalike&#8221;. That was her.

Anyway, I ended up going all Flaky McFlakerson on her. Big shock, right?

Well, anyway, we actually got to talking last night. We&#8217;re going to try to get together sometime soon and start over. I think it might be a good thing. She&#8217;s a really good person and is really pretty. I&#8217;m just worried. There are a lot of challenges to overcome, but I don&#8217;t know&#8230;I&#8217;m just kind of tired of the madcap bachelor lifestyle. I&#8217;m turning 30 in a few months and think it&#8217;s time to grow up finally.
