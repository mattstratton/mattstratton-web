[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5628" title="doniree" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/doniree-199x300.jpg" alt="doniree" width="199" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/doniree-199x300.jpg 199w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/11/doniree.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" />][1]I haven&#8217;t posted a [Fussy Follow Friday][2] recommendation in quite some time (actually, the <a href="/follow-friday/fussy-follow-friday-%E2%80%93-kellyg5" target="_self">last one</a> was back in July), but I feel that it&#8217;s time to start this up again. Not just because it&#8217;s easier to do these posts than actually write up the post I WANT to write, which will require a lot of pondering and thinking. No, no&#8230;it&#8217;s because I really, truly believe you should be following this person. Now.

This week I&#8217;m recommending you IMMEDIATELY <a href="https://twitter.com/doniree" target="_blank">click on this link</a> and follow <a href="https://twitter.com/doniree" target="_blank"><strong>@doniree</strong></a>. In addition to being a super-inspirational blogger, she&#8217;s a genuine and often hilarious Tweeter. And, in the interests of disclosure, I am assuring you that I started writing this blog post BEFORE I saw that <a href="https://doniree.com/2009/11/12/milestones-moving-forward-and-giveaway-winners/" target="_blank">she had offered to donate $5 to the charity of my choice</a>. I am totally telling the truth.

[**@doniree**][1] will improve your Twitter stream in ways that cannot be measured with current technology. You&#8217;ll laugh more. You&#8217;ll think more. And you&#8217;ll even pretend to understand Sanskrit.

_Fussy Follow Friday is based upon the concept that instead of a glut of Twitter follow recommendations, I will make one, and ONLY ONE, follow recommendation per Friday. For more information, the Library of Congress recommends <a href="../follow-friday/fussy-follow-friday/" target="_self">this blog post</a>._
