I&#8217;m sure by now everyone has heard the news &#8211; at approximately 9 AM EST, NASA lost contact with the space shuttle _Columbia_, which we now know broke up on re-entry, with all seven crew members perishing.

_Columbia_&#8216;s was our first space shuttle. This mission also carried with it the first Israeli astronaut, Ilan Ramon. Four of the seven crew members were on their first space flight.

It was reassuring (to me at least) to hear the President assure the country that in the light of this tragic event, our space program will continue. I personally would think it would be a poor legacy to these brave adventurers to stop our exploration and discovery.

Bush&#8217;s speech was properly respectful (I was very concerned about his ability to convey the proper dignity and condolences&#8230;being the &#8220;Healer in Chief&#8221; is no easy task).

The official words from our leaders have been properly respectful and sad, andI have heard nothing but pride from the Israeli government for Ilan Ramon.

Space travellers are a brave lot &#8211; we don&#8217;t appreciate them nearly enough, in our &#8220;Star Trek&#8221;-fed society, but they are bold explorers and deserving of our respect. Today&#8217;s events are tragic and saddening, as is all loss of life, but I believe in remembering our astronauts as intrepid and couragous adventurers setting out to further our understanding of our universe.

In a kind of weird way, it revitalizes my pride in the space program, and reminds me of why I hold astronauts in such high regard. It should remind us that these people knowingly put their very lives in jeopardy for the pure pursuit of knowledge and expanding our understanding

Walter Cronkite is on CNN right now talking about how &#8220;routine&#8221; we treat spaceflight &#8211; shuttle missions do not even make the papers anymore. It is sad that we live in a world where J-Lo and Affleck&#8217;s engagement is considered more interesting and newsworthy than brave explorers leaving the safety of our world to boldly adventure into the unknown.
