Just returned to my hotel from the Y7A party.

Man, this was a long day. Quick recap now, maybe more later (yeah, right).

  * **[Improv workshop][1]** this afternoon was fun. Everyone had a good time, which was my main goal.
  * &#8220;Yehoodi Tonight&#8221; (the &#8220;red carpet&#8221; thing that **[Nicole][2]** and I did for the main dance) was fun. I have about 1:20 to edit down to five minutes or so of sound bites, so I have some good confidence that it&#8217;ll be pretty good. Plus, I have **[Cindy][3]** on tape saying &#8220;Mugsy is damn sexy&#8221; (which was followed by Nicole&#8217;s comment &#8220;you heard it here first!&#8221;)
  * Nicole informed me that we couldn&#8217;t make out because it would ruin everything, like when they slept together on Moonlighting.
  * I got many compliments on my new suit. I felt sharp. Plus, a girl told me that I was &#8220;handsome&#8221; and that &#8220;not many men can match their shirt to their eyes&#8221;. Of course, I have brownish-hazel eyes, and was wearing a cobalt shirt, so take that as you will.
  * It&#8217;s been totally fun hanging out with **[Emmysue][4]**.
