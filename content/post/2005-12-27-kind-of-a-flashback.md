I was talking to RubyMae just now, and introducing her to overheardinnewyork.com.

And it reminded me that and I are pretty sure that I&#8217;ve been quoted on it&#8230;

This post:

_Guy: I don&#8217;t want to live in a building that undulates!
  
&#8211;Astor Place</p> 

</i>We&#8217;re fairly certain that it was me. The post in the site is from March 2003, but at the end of Feburary of that year, Amanda and I were in that location, talking about this high rise, and how it seemed to &#8220;undulate&#8221;.

So I might be famous.
