So I finally heard back from the recruiter about the Citadel job:

_
  
Matt &#8211;</p> 

Citadel is not going to proceed after all. They have changed the focus
  
of their job to an Exchange specialist, and not a Windows 2000/NT4
  
architect. I&#8217;ll let you know if anything else comes up.

Oh well.

I need a JAERB!
