I&#8217;ve been using Orbitz pretty exclusively since they first launched for purchasing airfares.

However, their website fails pretty hard with Firefox. I don&#8217;t want to have to fire up a separate browser just for Orbitz, so I am going to have to find a new one (at least for a while, according to the email response I got, they aren&#8217;t planning on updating any time soon).

Any suggestions? What do you guys all use for airfare purchases?

_Dear Matt,</p> 

Thank you for contacting Orbitz.

Orbitz supports the following browsers:

-Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher
  
-Netscape Communicator or Netscape Navigator 4.0
  
-AOL version 4.0 or higher.

However, I have forwarded your e-mail to our technical department. We
  
appreciate your time taken to write to us.

We value you as a customer and look forward to serving you again in the
  
future.

Sincerely,

Hazel
