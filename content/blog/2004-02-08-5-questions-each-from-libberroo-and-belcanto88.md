From :

_1. If you could date any movie star, who would it be and why?_
  
Parker Posey. For one thing, she&#8217;s pretty attractive. But actually, it&#8217;s more that I really really dig on her work. Of course, I know nothing about her personally, so outside of acting, she might be super dull. Plus she already has a boyfriend or husband or something.

_2. What, in your opinion, is the best thing, bar-none, that has ever been on television?_
  
&#8220;Greg the Bunny&#8221;. Sheer brilliance. Although, it wasn&#8217;t on for very long. So if it hadn&#8217;t been cancelled, perhaps it would have started to suck. But for serious, it had everything that would make me happy &#8211; an alcoholic monkey, Seth Green, Eugene Levy, and Sarah Silverman. Good times, great oldies.

_3. If you had to choose between a successful and sustaining lifelong career or a fulfilling and happy personal life which would you choose?_
  
Now, see, that&#8217;s tricky. Because to me, they&#8217;re the same. Or rather, a successful career is defined as one that makes me fulfilled and happy. But I doubt that is your intent with the question. But I still pick the first &#8211; assuming that the successful career is the one that I want, that is, a self-sustaining filmmaker. If it was to be a successful career as a stockbroker or something, then no.

_4. What is the worst thing you have ever eaten?_
  
Borscht.

_5. What&#8217;s your favorite word?_
  
&#8220;Recalcitrant&#8221;.

As asked by :

_1. where is your favorite place to be in the whole wide world?_
  
For serious, I think it&#8217;s in my own house, being comfortable, and being creative. I like going to cool places for vacations and stuff (Vegas, etc), but I am at my happiest when I&#8217;m sitting around and creating. It&#8217;s not a place I get to go a lot, but when I am there, it makes me a happy dude.

_2. so say you could have a four-course meal (appetizer, salad course, main course, dessert) comprised of any foods you wanted. what would you eat? and what would you want to drink with it?_
  
Appetizer: those deep-fried asparagus and beef thingies they have at Tombo.
  
Salad: A nice crisp lettuce with lots and LOTS OF cucumbers, and a good 1,000 Island dressing.
  
Main Course: A juicy steak, on the pink side of medium rare, with the perfect marinade and/or infusion. Garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli on the side.
  
Dessert: Strawberry rhubarb pie with vanilla ice cream where you can see the pieces of vanilla bean IN the ice cream
  
Beverage: Lots and lots of Sprecher&#8217;s root beer.

(Funny thing&#8230;I just realized that that&#8217;s basically what Carrie made me for dinner for my birthday.)

_3. what&#8217;s the most valuable piece of grooming/style information you&#8217;ve learned from the fab 5?_
  
Spray, delay, then walk away. (I already knew to shave with the grain of the beard.)

_4. if you could be an adult swim character, who would you be?_
  
Meatwad. Because he makes the money, see? Meatwad, he gets the honeys, see.

_5. what color is your funk machine?_
  
What a great question. My funk machine is kind of purple, with subtle stripes of metallic green. And it has fuzzy dice.
