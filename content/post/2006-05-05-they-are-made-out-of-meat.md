Found out about this thanks to

One of my favorite short stories when I was younger, has been made into a short film.   [ <img src="http://static.flickr.com/52/140968147_35e2fa2f1c.jpg?v=0" align="right" border="1" height="185" hspace="2" vspace="2" width="225" />They are made out of meat.][1]

I first read this story when it appeared in _OMNI_. I think I was either in junior high, or a freshman in high school. I loved it so much that I cut it out of the magazine and pinned it up on my bulletin board.

I was a nerd then, too.
