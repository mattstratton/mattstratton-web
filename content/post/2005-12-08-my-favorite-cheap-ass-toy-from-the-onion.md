**1 Modern Circle: Barbie Producer ($9.99, from $28.99)**

At this point in her auspicious career, Barbie has toiled in every trade short of truck-stop hooker. The 1 Modern Circle Barbie Producer doll thrillingly reintroduces Barbie as an &#8220;indie film producer looking to cast her leading man.&#8221; The back of the box offers a tantalizing glimpse into Barbie&#8217;s life: &#8220;Barbie immediately turns to her trusted assistant Melody and says â€˜Melody, your priority is to set up interviews with prospective additional crew.'&#8221; Can your child handle the excitement? Producer Barbie, the Christine Vachon of the doll world, comes with a laptop, midriff-baring outfit, and cell phone to hurl angrily at Melody&#8217;s stupid fucking head after she forgets to pick up Barbie&#8217;s toy poodle from the groomer.
