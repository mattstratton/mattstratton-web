**Swazi king blames women&#8217;s trousers for world&#8217;s ills**

MBABANE, Swaziland (Reuters) &#8212; Swaziland&#8217;s absolute monarch has singled out women wearing pants as the cause of the world&#8217;s ills in a state radio sermon that also condemned human rights as an &#8220;abomination before God.&#8221;

&#8220;The Bible says curse be unto a woman who wears pants, and those who wear their husband&#8217;s clothes. That is why the world is in such a state today,&#8221; Mswati, ruler of the impoverished feudal nation of about one million, said late on Thursday.

The Times of Swaziland reported that the monarch, who reigns supreme in the landlocked country run by palace appointees and where opposition parties are banned, went on to criticize the human rights movement.

&#8220;What rights? God created people, and He gave them their roles in society. You cannot change what God has created. This is an abomination before God,&#8221; the king told an audience of conservative church leaders.

Women on the streets of capital Mbabane were not impressed.

&#8220;The king says I am the cause of the world&#8217;s problems because of my outfit. Never mind terrorism, government corruption, poverty and disease, it&#8217;s me and my pants. I reject that,&#8221; said Thob&#8217;sile Dlamini.
