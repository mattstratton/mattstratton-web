I&#8217;ve realized that quite a few people don&#8217;t really know what &#8220;the story&#8221; is with my potential move. I know I allude to it a lot, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve really explained it.

So here&#8217;s the story.

As part of my midlife crisis, I kind of want a change in scenery. The only other city I&#8217;ve been to that I can see myself living in is New York&nbsp; Plus, I have an &#8220;instant network&#8221; there. My plan (which still exists) is to visit NYC once a month or so and really try to feel out how comfortable I am there. My next visit is the end of Feb.

The move is very dependent on work. I will only go if I can remain a JPMC employee &#8211; either finding a position in our New York offices, or do a remote position. I can&#8217;t switch positions until I&#8217;ve been in this one for a year, so the very very earliest this would happen would be October of this year. And everything is in such a state of flux with the merger that I can&#8217;t even begin to figure out what kind of positions will be available at the end of the year.

There are still a lot of things to be figured out. I do know that from what I&#8217;ve seen, that I like Brooklyn a lot. In theory, I should investigate other areas further, but part of me doesn&#8217;t want to.

So now you know. Questions?
