So it&#8217;s Pesach.

Last night was a very conflicted seder for me. On one hand, it was the best seder I can recall &#8211; I spent it with dear friends, and really felt like it was a family. We even added a fifth question (&#8220;Hey&#8230;is Elijah Hispanic?&#8221;) which I think will be part of E and N&#8217;s haggadah from now on.

But then there is the horror of Netanya.

I&#8217;m not going to get on a soapbox here. I don&#8217;t pretend to know that solution.

But I know that last night, as I said the words &#8220;Next year in Jerusalem&#8221;, it had a whole different meaning.
