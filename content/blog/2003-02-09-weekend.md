Had a damn good time in Atlanta this weekend for [JET][1]!

Lots of drinking, lots of eating, and lots of pictures.

And to update&#8230;nothing new has progressed with Gaga Girl #2. Le sigh.

But if you go clicky-clicky, you can see some of the rough shots from yesterday&#8217;s photo shoot!

Remember, these are not color-corrected or cleaned up at all yet&#8230;
