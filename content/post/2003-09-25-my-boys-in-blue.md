This is from an email I just sent to my mom. I&#8217;m posting it in its entirety, but some of it might not make sense because of that.

_Took me a second to realize that you meant &#8220;neighborhood&#8221; and not &#8220;neighbor&#8221;. Now it&#8217;s much clearer._

_I think it&#8217;s just a feeling of validation. I was trying to explain to a (non-Chicago) friend of mine last night how I can be a lukewarm baseball fan, but a hardcore Cubs fan. She didn&#8217;t understand why I could love watching the Cubs, and get invested in the Cubs, but not really care much about the rest of the game._

_My answer was that I&#8217;ve spent my life as a Cubs fan. I remember being excited watching the Cubs face off against the Padres at a Cub Scout meeting in our living room. I remember my Rick Sutcliffe and Ryne Sandburg baseball cards. I remember liking the fireworks at Comiskey, but otherwise being upset at having to watch the Sox play instead of the Cubs._

_I think being a Cubs fan makes you feel special. You&#8217;re the opposite of a fair-weather fan (although I suppose that&#8217;s generally true of being a Chicago sports fan at all). Sure, it&#8217;s easy to root for the Yankees, because they win all the time. But living and dying by the Friendly Confines shows heart._

_Either that or the inability to get out of a destructive relationship. If the Cubs were a person, nobody would have stuck with them for as long as we have, after all the pain and grief they&#8217;ve caused us. But we keep going back for more. And now, finally, they&#8217;ve come out of therapy and are going to make it all better by buying us a nice gift._

_OK, that&#8217;s way too many metaphors. I have to get back to work :)_
