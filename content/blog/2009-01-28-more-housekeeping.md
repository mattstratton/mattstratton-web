I&#8217;m afraid that for the time being, this blog is going to be oh-so-very meta. Blogging about blogging. Mostly, this is due to the fact that today I was busy working for a living, and didn&#8217;t have a chance to create the content I&#8217;d hoped to do today.

Last night I was up until about 1:30 am tagging and categorizing posts. I also was going crazy adding new plugins to my WordPress install. I&#8217;m getting a little obsessed.

As it&#8217;s getting to be time for me to run off to a meeting, I&#8217;ll finish up this post with some of the target areas of improvement I&#8217;d like to do with this site. And also, a list of some upcoming posts.

Areas of Improvement:

  * Re-do the top banner/header/image. I love how it rotates through (although I have to add some more custom content) but it&#8217;s WAY too tall.
  * Add an &#8220;about me&#8221; page.
  * Figure out other interesting pages to create besides the aforementioned &#8220;about me&#8221;. Any suggestions?

Upcoming posts:

  * **Photo gear listing** &#8211; sharing with you all my weapons of choice for photography. I&#8217;m not cool enough to rock a 50D, but I do have some decent toys.
  * **Photoshop tricks and tips** &#8211; not anything I can really claim as 100% my own, but I&#8217;ve been tweaking some techniques, mostly based upon Scott Kelby stuff.
  * **What the hell am I going to do about Windows 7?** &#8211; some initial thoughts, but mostly a report on how I think I&#8217;m going to completely re-build my computer. Again.
  * **Gaming and Matt Stratton** &#8211; I have some games I like, and others I&#8217;m not sure why I play them. This post will tell you all about it.
  * **Reflections on the Fizzy Bizzy** &#8211; Social networking is what all the cool kids are doing. I&#8217;ll expound upon why I never was cool in high school, but I now feel that I am.
