&#8220;[Wrigley Field is] a packed house tonight..most of the people here to get a glimpse of Barry Bonds&#8221;

Yeah, right guys. 90% of the people in the stands wouldn&#8217;t recognize Barry Bonds if he was sitting right next to him. Granted, 89% of the people in the stands wouldn&#8217;t recognize Derrek Lee or Carlos Zambrano either, but I&#8217;m sorry, ESPN &#8211; just because you have a big chubber for Bonds doesn&#8217;t mean that the boozehounds in Wrigley do too.
