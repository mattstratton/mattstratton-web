        This is a picture of my wife&#8217;s cousin, Claire, from the family Christmas party. I&#8217;ll be honest &#8211; the main reason I&#8217;m posting this here now is to make sure my Flickr-post-to-blog is working for my WordPress blog.

        I also like to have multiple paragraphs when I post a picture from Flickr, especially a portrait oriented picture.

        I really don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m still awake at almost 2 AM.
