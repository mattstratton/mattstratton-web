My friend John here at work just developed a new tool for estimating how long it will take us to complete server builds.

This was the note he just sent me:

<font color="#0000ff"><b>John Smyth 4-8247</b></font> &#8211; Feel free to poke around, try it out, see if it generates numbers that you think are accurate.&nbsp; If you want to use it, I think we should re-name it &#8211; maybe &#8220;Resource Estimate Calculating Time Modeler.&#8221;&nbsp; That way, if someone asks you where you got your numbers, you can tell them &#8220;I pulled them out of my RECTM.&#8221;&nbsp; Or you can distribute to the PM&#8217;s and if they bug you for estimates you can tell them to stick it in their RECTM.
