        I'm totally stealing an idea from Ashalah, and using the "question and answer" format to try to pry myself out of a blogging hiatus. Just ask me questions (by commenting on the blog post) you'd like me to answer about anything and I will answer in a post next week.

I&#8217;m totally stealing an idea from <a href="http://ashalah.com" target="_blank">Ashalah</a>, and using the &#8220;question and answer&#8221; format to try to pry myself out of a blogging hiatus. Just ask me questions you&#8217;d like me to answer about anything and I will answer in a post next week.

HOW &#8211; Post your question either as a comment on this blog post, or send me an @ message on Twitter (I&#8217;m <a href="http://twitter.com/mattstratton" target="_blank">@mattstratton</a>)

WHAT &#8211; I&#8217;ll answer questions about pretty much anything. They can be technical (WordPress, SharePoint, etc)&#8230; or personal. Or maybe you just want to know my opinion on a subject. Within reason, the topic can be pretty much anything.

WHEN &#8211; The answer post will most likely come out on Monday&#8230;I want to make sure there&#8217;s plenty of time for folks to pose their questions.

WHY &#8211; Everyone who asks a question will have their name entered into a drawing for a nifty prize. The prize is currently TBD, but it&#8217;ll be cool, I promise.
