It&#8217;s getting tough to have these conversations with Gaga Girl #2&#8230;

Mugsy: It&#8217;s fun to see you so excited
  
Gaga Girl #2: i&#8217;m so geeking right now!!!
  
Gaga Girl #2: it&#8217;s like, part of me is so sure this will all fall apart
  
Gaga Girl #2: cuz i like him SOOO much
  
Gaga Girl #2: and i have not liked a guy this much in a long time
  
Gaga Girl #2: perhaps since my very first boyfriend
  
Gaga Girl #2: but not even then
  
&#8212;
  
Gaga Girl #2: i should go to the gym though
  
Gaga Girl #2: that&#8217;s the only problem with pursuing a very fit guy
  
Gaga Girl #2: i feel very&#8230;pudgy
  
Mugsy: well like you have said to me before
  
Mugsy: that shouldn&#8217;t matter
  
Gaga Girl #2: it shouldn&#8217;t
  
Gaga Girl #2: and we talked about that last night too
  
Gaga Girl #2: and he said he thinks all bodies are beautiful, because of what they can do, and less about how they look, kind of thing
  
Gaga Girl #2: it could have been a lame pick up line
  
Gaga Girl #2: but&#8230;who knows
  
Gaga Girl #2: all i know is, brother has a pretty amazing six pack
  
Gaga Girl #2:
  
Mugsy: very nice
  
Gaga Girl #2: yay swimmers
