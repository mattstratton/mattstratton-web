So I&#8217;m back from my Vegas trip.

Our story begins on Saturday around 1 PM. I am at the Barbary Coast casino with Backstreet and Partytom. Sit down at a $5 blackjack table, and buy $100 worth of chips. Play a few hands, up and down. End up about exactly even. Toss my $5 chips at the dealer and ask for color. She gives me a $100 chip, and I get ready to walk away.

But something inside me says &#8220;Go for it, asshole!&#8221; So I toss the chip on the betting circle and say &#8220;let&#8217;s go for it.&#8221;

Cards are dealt, and the dealer and I push (for those of you unfamiliar with blackjack, it means we tied). Backstreet says &#8220;Don&#8217;t push your luck,&#8221; encouraging me to take my $100 chip and run. But I left it out there.

Dealer gives me a ten and a three&#8230;and she&#8217;s showing a picture card. Shit. Nothing to do but take a hit. And get an EIGHT! Whoohoo! Mugsy wins $100.

Flash forward to Saturday evening after dinner. We are at the Frontier casino. Play a little blackjack and win a couple bucks. Then Backstreet and Partytom want to play craps. Now, normally, I don&#8217;t play craps. I don&#8217;t really know how to play it, and I never win much money doing it. But I figure, why not.

Walk over to the table. Five dollar minimum bet. I only want to gamble with $40, but I just have hundreds, so I buy $100 worth of chips and put $60 worth in my pocket. Gambling progresses; I do decent, and end up about $11 up. Whoohoo. Decide it&#8217;s time to walk away. Put my playing chips in my pocket, and say &#8220;let&#8217;s go find the rest.&#8221;

But no, we have to wait for Backstreet&#8217;s cocktail to arrive. So Partytom says &#8220;Fuck it&#8230;I&#8217;m going for the Hail Mary,&#8221; and throws $50 on the field.

(Quick sidenote&#8230;the field bet is a one-time bet which states simply: if the shooter throws a 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12 then you win. If a 5, 6, 7, or 8 are thrown then you lose. At this casino, the field paid even money, except the 2, which was double, and 12 was triple. This will be important later.)

So I figure I&#8217;ll play along with Tom; I pull out my chips to toss them on the field bet, but quickly realize that I have $100 worth of chips, which I don&#8217;t want to bet. By the time I pull out what I do want, the shooter has tossed the dice, and Tom has lost the bet.

It&#8217;s time for drama. So I take the $111 out of my pocket and place it on the field. &#8220;All in on the field,&#8221; I say.

Shooter rolls a 10. Bam! I just made $111 profit on that bet. Kick ass.

&#8220;Want to let it ride?&#8221; the stickman asks sarcastically?

&#8220;Hell yes,&#8221; I said. That&#8217;s right. I now have a $222 bet on the field. This is a bet where the house has a 5.5% advantage over the player. But what the hell.

&#8220;Come on 12!&#8221; Partytom yells. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see those boxcars!&#8221;

The shooter rolls a twelve. That&#8217;s right. I hit a 3 to 1 payout on $222. Backstreet, Partytom, and I look at each other and whoop it up.

&#8220;Let that one ride?&#8221; the stickman asks.

&#8220;Nope. Give me color!&#8221; I shout.

The dealers pay me out. I toss a $25 chip down &#8220;for the boys&#8221; and give the shooter a $25 chip of her own.

For those of you keeping track, I&#8217;ve just made a little over $800 on two rolls of the dice.

I&#8217;ll post the blackjack story a little later; it happened about 30 minutes after the craps story, and long story short &#8211; in an attempt to make my friend Sean feel like a jackass, I made him about $170 and $170 for myself as well :)
