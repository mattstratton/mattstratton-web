So a friend of mine told me today that I am too competitive.

This is a problem.

I know that in the past, I&#8217;ve been very VERY competitive. And it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve tried to tame. Apparently, I must not be doing a good job. This person is someone who knows me pretty well. So if she sees it, it&#8217;s probably there.

I think some competition is good. I don&#8217;t think I could be involved with a girl in a relationship who didn&#8217;t have some competitive spirit. I don&#8217;t mean competing financially or emotionally. But if I&#8217;m playing a game against my girl, I want her playing balls-out. Because **I** will be.

Competition has started to make me not want to bowl with C anymore. He&#8217;s very competitive. And now when we bowl it&#8217;s about who is beating whom. And of course, he usually wins, since he **is** a better bowler than I. He&#8217;s better at almost all games/sports than I, for that matter. And when he doesn&#8217;t win, he claims &#8220;oh, I wasn&#8217;t really trying anyway.&#8221; It&#8217;s as if he doesn&#8217;t want to play if he can&#8217;t be the winner. I don&#8217;t want to be that guy.

I think the reason my competitive nature is healthy is this &#8211; while a game or contest is going on, I am playing to win. Because that&#8217;s the purpose of playing. Otherwise we would play games like &#8220;The Ungame&#8221; where there are no winners. Never heard of &#8220;The Ungame&#8221;? That&#8217;s because it was a dumb game with no winners, so nobody played it.

Now, after the game/contest is over, if I lose, I generally feel that I don&#8217;t dwell on it. I will probably try to figure out WHY I lost, but it doesn&#8217;t mean I didn&#8217;t have a good time.

What do you think?
