For all my friends out there on OS X&#8230;

My new favorite little piece of software is WeatherPop.

It chills out in your menu bar and tells you the weather. So next to my little Airport signal icon, I&#8217;ve got one that says 9 degrees, with an icon of clouds.

If you click on it, it tells you more!

I highly recommend it. I&#8217;m running the beta that includes a screensaver that replicates the current weather. Neat shit, yo.
