Photoblogging is a very popular category in the blog-o-verse, and since Good Old Rock loves some photography, this week I&#8217;ve decided to feature Jason Daniel Photography, the photoblog of my good friend Jason Wyckoff.

I have known Jason since we first ran against each other for Student Council Treasurer in 6th grade (I actually won, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that nobody could tell the difference between the two of us). In addition to being longtime friends, in 1999 Jason and I created SwingHomeChicago/<a href="http://windyhop.org" target="_blank">Windyhop</a> (the online resource for swing dancing in Chicago) and ran it for seven (?) years.

Recently, Jason has become interested in photography, and he&#8217;s really come a long way in a short amount of time in terms of talent and skill. For 2009, Jason has taken on the daunting undertaking of Project 365, which challenges a photographer to take a picture every day for a year. He has been chronicling his efforts in this photoblog.

Some of Jason&#8217;s best work comes from his great eye for environments. For obvious reasons, his two children are often featured in his daily shots, but, in my opinion, Jason really excels when he is capturing a moment in time for a certain location. Some of my favorite shots which exemplify this include:

  * <a href="http://jasondanielphotography.com/blog/2009/03/30/a-morning-with-god/" target="_blank">A Morning with God</a>
  * <a href="http://jasondanielphotography.com/blog/2009/03/26/mollys-pond-81365/" target="_blank">Molly&#8217;s Pond</a>
  * <a href="http://jasondanielphotography.com/blog/2009/03/11/rainy-day-66365/" target="_blank">Rainy Day</a>
  * <a href="http://jasondanielphotography.com/blog/2009/03/08/print-of-the-month/" target="_blank">Harbor Magic</a>

I&#8217;m thrilled that Jason and I have a new way to connect in our love for photography (and lately, with WordPress tweaks and customizations). I&#8217;m proud of the work he&#8217;s been doing and his commitment to Project 365. If you enjoy fine and compelling photography, I highly encourage you to add <a href="http://jasondanielphotography.com/blog" target="_blank">Jason Daniel Photography</a> to your feed reader.
