So some of you may remember that two summers ago, a &#8220;friend&#8221; of mine wore out here welcome by [staying at my house WAY too long][1], etc, etc.

Well, out of curiosity tonight, I Googled her name.

And came up with [this][2]:

> “Caroline Dwyer is basically a fraud. She has worked for about 5-6 families in the USA all of which would like to have her arrested and/or deported. She has stolen, runs up multi-$100 or $1000 phone bills per month, has stolen from at least 3 of the families. She has also set up fake email accounts so as to have families contact them thinking they are contacting previous families so as to inform her new unsuspecting families that she is a great aupair &#8211; where as in fact, you are emailing her, and she responds with how great she is.
> 
> She lies about her mother being ill with cancer, so as to make you let her get by with some of her antics, she stole a cellular phone from my family and never returned it, ran up over 4,500 minutes of use in one month, she never returned any of my calls. She has an expired visa and expired passport.”

That was posted in late August, of 2004&#8230;just a few weeks after she left my house.

So I guess I wasn&#8217;t too far off by suspecting that she might steal my Powerbook.

EDIT: Looking further, I found this post, which is dated right before she came to stay with me.

> Caroline Dwyer got my name off of Craig&#8217;s list&#8230;I was looking for a roomate to fill my second bedroom. Caroline has borderline personality disorder. She seems sweet, but she lies, steals, takes things, is not dependable, not trustworthy, lost multiple jobs, her list of references were people that were her friends or those that she knew for two weeks. She ran up my phone bill, used my things after asking her numerous times not to&#8230;making up ridiculous excuses. I changed my locks on my doors. She is here illegally &#8211; she needs to be in therapy and needs serious medical attention. She is from Australia and tries to get babysitting jobs and nanny positions. Do not lend her money, as she will never pay you back. She cannot be trusted. She has not responded to my emails or phone calls and abandoned all of her things at the apartment for me to deal with.

It all makes so much more sense now. Scary stuff.

Edit the second. Further searching on Google Groups turns up [this post][3] by her in July of 2004 (when she was staying at my house):

_I&#8217;ve overstayed my student visa by a year and a half, thereby
  
violating it. Am in the midst of making plans to return to Australia
  
next week, but have found out that the INS is now looking me. What are
  
my best options from here?_

_*Should I make plans to leave asap and just get on the plane as
  
normal, or turn myself in to the INS?
  
*If I do turn myself in with the help of the Australian consulate, is
  
it possible they can reach an agreement with the INS that would result
  
in my own leaving, rather than deportation?
  
*If the INS refuses and says I am to be deported, what happens next?
  
Process, etc.
  
*If I end up leaving on my own accord with passport and ticket, what
  
can I expect at that airport (LAX)?_

_Thanks, advice is appreciated._
