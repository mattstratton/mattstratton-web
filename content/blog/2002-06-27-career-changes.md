Well, I guess I can share this with all of you&#8230;

I am no longer employed by GE Capital.

I&#8217;m not going to get into the details&#8230;some of you know the story, but regardless, let&#8217;s leave it at this wasn&#8217;t a big surprise. I knew it was coming, but I thought it was going to be in September.

So this means that I&#8217;m going to have to start my career as a filmmaking bartender just a little earlier.

I&#8217;m going to Atlanta next week (July 1-8) and then NYC the weekend after (July 11-15)&#8230;yay for Priceline. I figure the Atlanta trip is going to be a chance to get away, recenter, and make my plans. And NYC is, well, NYC. Plus I got super cheap fares. Now I just have to be super cheap when I&#8217;m THERE.

I start bartending school on July 22. So once I get a job you all have to come buy drinks from me.
