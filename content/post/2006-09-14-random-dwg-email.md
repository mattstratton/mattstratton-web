So yesterday, I got this email from some dude with [AFI][1]:

_I am interested in getting a screener of your film for a live event. I am originally from the Chicago area and really enjoyed the trailer I saw on Customflix.com&#8217;s site. If this is something you are interested in, please contact me._

I haven&#8217;t emailed him back yet, but Dallas and I have been chatting. It&#8217;s been so long since I&#8217;ve done anything with submitting to festivals that I am not sure exactly what to send him. I have two copies of the film on Digibeta, but I&#8217;m not sending those out randomly (since the tapes cost like $90). I think what I will do is email him, and tell him I&#8217;ll send him a [copy of the movie on DVD][2], along with our [PDF press kit][3], and mention that I do have it on Digibeta as well if he needs that.

Those of you who know about such things &#8211; does that sound right?

We&#8217;re pretty sure that he&#8217;s talking about [DWG][4], because our other CustomFlix stuff doesn&#8217;t have a trailer.

**Matt:** also just double checked to make sure that inventing: films does not have a trailer on customflix :)
  
**Matt:** also just rewatched the dwg trailer
  
**Matt:** to make sure that it doesn&#8217;t look a LOT better than the actual movie :)
  
**Matt:** I think the only disappointment would be that there&#8217;s not nearly enough Fuzzy
  
**Dallas:** Like much of life, there&#8217;s not nearly enough Fuzzy.
