My stupid BlackBerry has stopped receiving email from my Gmail for some reason. I cannot puzzle out why, but I have not gotten any emails on my BB since about 1 PM today. And yesterday, for several hours (read: &#8220;during the Cubs game&#8221;) it would not send emails either.

This is, as the kids would say, teh suck.
