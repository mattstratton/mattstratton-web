I try to keep this page updated with my upcoming talks, as well as past speaking engagements.

Want to have me come speak at your conference, user group, or Meetup? I'm happy to chat! [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=mattstratton) and let's talk! I like to talk about incident response, DevOps, humane ops, and animated GIF's.
