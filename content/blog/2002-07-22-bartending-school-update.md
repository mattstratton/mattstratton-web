First day of Bartending School was today.

We learned &#8220;two-liquor drinks&#8221; (things like Black Russian, Godfather, etc). So I now have 18 new drinks under my belt.

Tomorrow are Sours.

So far, so good. I&#8217;m getting the hand of speed pouring, and I think I&#8217;ll be able to handle the ordering thing (we did some drills today with multiple orders; I got a little flustered at first, but I am sure it will get better with time).
