So I decided to (literally) stay home for Thanksgiving this weekend.

My folks and sisters are going to a family friend for the holiday tomorrow, and I didn&#8217;t feel like hauling my happy ass out to the burbs for that (instead, I&#8217;m just going to the folks&#8217; on Saturday for dinner and such). I figured it would be nice to have a day all to myself. I planned to sit at home, eat pumpkin pie, and watch lots of movies I&#8217;d recorded on my DVR.

Well, last night, my cable box stopped working. Which means I have no DVR. Comcast can&#8217;t get someone out to fix it until Monday. So strike one.

I got my groceries delivered today, and the pumpkin pie I ordered was &#8220;out of stock&#8221;, so they sent me another one, which I&#8217;ll have to bake. Which isn&#8217;t the end of the world, but I intentionally selected a premade one, so as to be able to be ultimately lazy tomorrow. Strike 2.

I can&#8217;t think of what strike three could be, unless it would be my heat going out. That would suck, since it&#8217;s supposed to be like 20 degrees tomorrow.
