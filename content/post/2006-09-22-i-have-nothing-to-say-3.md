First of all, this picture has nothing to do with my post, but I think Kate looks hilarious. 

Yesterday Carrie and I met our wedding photographer, [Becky Hill][1], at Milennium Park for our &#8220;engagement&#8221; photos. I will admit that I was NOT looking forward to this. I thought it was a useless idea, but Carrie wanted to do it, so I agreed.

It turned out to be a VERY good thing. Do I think that we&#8217;ll order prints of any of the photos? Probably not. However, it was a GREAT dry run for the wedding pictures. I do NOT like having my picture taken, and I am certainly not used to spending that amount of time having that done. It was weird, but I&#8217;m glad I got that out of the way on the photos that don&#8217;t &#8220;matter&#8221;. Also, once we can see the pictures, I&#8217;m guessing I&#8217;ll be able to look through them and figure out what \*not\* to do for the wedding photos.

On the biking front, I&#8217;ve been a slacker this week. I rode on Monday, but then skipped three days. I rode in this morning, and it was QUITE unpleasant. When I left, it was just slightly misting. But as soon as I turned onto Lincoln Avenue, I was blasted with a fierce wind that didn&#8217;t let up for the entire 7 mile ride. Worse, when I was about 3 miles away from work, it started to rain like it meant it. And then, once I reached the Loop, it REALLY started to come down &#8211; stinging rain with gusty winds. Eww!

But I&#8217;m here at work now. I&#8217;m just not sure how I&#8217;m going to make sure my riding clothes get dry enough for my ride home. My workplace is kind of stuffy, and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d take too kindly to me draping my dripping wet dryfit over my cube wall.
