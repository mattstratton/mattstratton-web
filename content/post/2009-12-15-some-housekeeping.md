[<img class="alignright" title="Housekeeping" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3140/2580879201_f33871ba2b.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="300" />][1]You might notice things look a little different around here. I&#8217;m giving my blog a much-needed facelift. Granted, I&#8217;m not done yet, but I&#8217;m just setting the stage for some new fancy designs that are on their way (with the assistance of the amazingly awesome <a href="http://twitter.com/ashleymarie6" target="_blank">@ashleymarie6</a>).

## New theme

First major overhaul item was switching to the <a href="http://diythemes.com/" target="_blank">Thesis theme</a>. It appears that all the truly &#8216;leet WordPress folks are all about Thesis&#8230;or at least that&#8217;s what <a href="http://doniree.com" target="_blank">Doniree</a> tells me. It&#8217;s not so much a theme as it is an entire framework. It&#8217;s super customizable, although it takes a bit of hacking to really find your way around. But just playing around with the configuration options has already gotten me to some things that I totally dig. For example &#8211; those little &#8220;teasers&#8221; for past blog posts on the bottom of the page. I like those.

## Cleaning up the junk

You might recall&#8230;my blog generally quickly turns into a big mess of sidebar cruft. Every now and then it&#8217;s time to go through it and really optimize what is over there. I removed a lot of junk, and added a &#8220;Featured Posts&#8221; section. That area still needs a lot of style redesign, but at least the content has been streamlined.

## Linky love

Another change is the removal of the Blogroll from every single page on the site. It&#8217;s been moved to a <a href="/links/blogroll" target="_self">dedicated page</a> under the &#8220;Links&#8221; menu up on top. Those of you who are in my blogroll might fear this is going to impact the Google juice you get from me, but I really don&#8217;t think it will be that determental. Plus, it just makes my pages look a lot cleaner.

I&#8217;ve added another link page &#8211; the <a href="/links/social-networking" target="_self">Social Networking</a> page. This contains links to my profiles on popular social networking sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. It&#8217;s still a work in progress, but it&#8217;s a start.

I&#8217;ll be adding more link pages as well, specifically one with photography links and technology links.

## What&#8217;s next?

Ashley is working on a new header for me, and she&#8217;s got a lot of recommendations for redesign, so don&#8217;t get too comfortable with my look and feel. I&#8217;m also going to keep tweaking the Featured Content area as well (there are some cool options for displaying Featured Content with Thesis that I&#8217;m going to explore).

_What do you think of the changes so far? Any suggestions? Anything you think REALLY needs to be fixed? Let me know in the comments!_
