There are many different ways to attract visitors/readers to your blog. You could just hope that they stumble across your site randomly, but that&#8217;s not a very proactive method. One major source of traffic is going to be from people using search engines like Google to discover articles/posts on topics that are interesting to them &#8211; and you can help by making it easier for your blog to be indexed by the search engines.

You may or may not be familiar with the term &#8220;SEO&#8221; &#8211; it stands for &#8220;Search Engine Optimization&#8221;, and it&#8217;s kind of a catch-all term for &#8220;making your blog or website show up higher in Google.&#8221; There are TONS of tricks and tips about increasing your SEO, and frankly, quite a few of them are snake oil and probably have nothing to do with actual results.

One thing that DOES make a difference in your SEO is the format of your URL&#8217;s. By default, each post will have a URL kind of like this: www.yourblog.com/?p=138. That URL doesn&#8217;t tell anyone (be they a person or a search engine) anything about the content on that page. So we need to change the URL to be more &#8220;SEO-friendly&#8221;, i.e., to a URL that gives a teasing little peek into the content of the post.

The first step is to go into your WordPress control panel, and scroll down on the left to the link for &#8220;Settings&#8221;. Under that heading, you&#8217;ll see a link for &#8220;Permalinks&#8221;. Click on it. You will see a screen that looks kind of like this:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/permalinks.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5591" title="permalinks" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/permalinks.png" alt="permalinks" width="567" height="457" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/permalinks.png 709w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/10/permalinks-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" /></a>
</p>

I have my permalinks set up to use the format of &#8220;day and name&#8221;, which means that I can have multiple posts that have the same name, but they are made unique by the inclusion of the year/month/date. You might be more interested in doing just month and name&#8230;or even go into &#8220;custom structure&#8221; and make it in yet another format.

Once you&#8217;ve made this change, you will now find it essential to create an SEO-friendly title in your permalink when you create new posts. For example, if I look at the default permalink for this post, it just takes the title &#8211; which is a little wordy:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/posttitle.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5592" title="posttitle" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/posttitle.png" alt="posttitle" width="673" height="88" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/posttitle.png 962w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/10/posttitle-300x39.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" /></a>
</p>

If I&#8217;d rather have a bit of a shorter permalink, I would click &#8220;edit&#8221; to change it to something I think is better. In this case, I&#8217;m pretty pleased with the permalink, so I&#8217;ll leave it as it is.

Basically, think about the ways in which someone might search for the post &#8211; that&#8217;s what you want the permalink to be. If you post was about cranberry sauce recipes, you wouldn&#8217;t want the permalink to be &#8220;Shane&#8217;s Super Awesome Cranberry Sauce Recipe&#8221; &#8211; even though that would be a great title for the post. The permalink should be &#8220;cranberry-sauce-recipe&#8221;. Dig?

There are several other things to bear in mind when it comes to SEO and WordPress. There&#8217;s a great plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/" target="_blank">&#8220;All in One SEO Pack&#8221;</a> which can help a lot. Unfortunately, the latest version of the plugin is not currently working on my installation. Once I get it working again, however, I&#8217;ll post a follow-up blog that dives into the advantages and tricks of using that plugin.
