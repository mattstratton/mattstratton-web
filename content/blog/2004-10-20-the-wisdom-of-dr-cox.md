It seems like almost everyone on my friends list has posted the very same quote from last night&#8217;s episode of Scrubs.

It is indeed a beautiful sentiment.

&#8220;People are bastards. Bastard coated bastards with bastard filling.&#8221;

That being said&#8230;I&#8217;m about ready for JD&#8217;s brother to leave. He is funny every now and again, but enough is enough already.

It&#8217;s a great show.
