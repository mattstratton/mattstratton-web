Remember! This is secret! No posting this ANYWHERE&#8230;

I&#8217;ll post more details later, and be looking for insight.

But it will happen on Saturday, March 4th.

I am flying Carrie to NYC. She has never been there before. She does NOT know we are going.

And that is where I will give her this:

Here&#8217;s the breakdown of the plan, so far (all times are Eastern, naturally):

Saturday, March 4

1 PM &#8211; Carrie and Matt arrive at LGA on United. Heather T-B (Carrie&#8217;s best friend) and Chris R. arrive at LGA on American Airlines.

1:30 PM &#8211; Carrie and Matt check into their hotel.

2:00 PM &#8211; Carrie and Matt go someplace. Eli is there disguised as a tourist.

2:05 PM &#8211; Matt proposes to Carrie. Eli surreptitiously photographs the entire thing without Carrie noticing.

5 PM &#8211; Matt and Carrie go to meet &#8220;some friends&#8221; for dinner. Surprise, surprise, those friends turn out to be Heather T-B and Chris (and whoever else).

Later evening &#8211; Everyone meets up somewhere for drinks to celebrate Carrie and Heather Flock&#8217;s birthdays.

Sunday, March 5

Brunch-thirty: New York brunch action with whomever

2 PM &#8211; Carrie, Matt, Chris, and Heather T-B (and whoever else is interested) go to see Avenue Q.

8 PM &#8211; Heather T-B and Chris fly home

Monday, March 6

1:55 PM &#8211; Carrie and Matt fly home.

Here is what I need help/advice/input on:

1. Hotel recommendation for Carrie and Matt
     
2. Location recommendation for actual proposal (including bad weather backup)
     
3. Someplace for Chris and Heather T-B to stay on Saturday night

Some proposed proposal locations:

* Empire State Building (possible issues due to lines, etc)
      
* Central Park
      
* Some random little park in Midtown

What do you guys think?
