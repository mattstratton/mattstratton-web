I seriously am having some trouble with this whole &#8220;waiting until March 4th&#8221; thing.

I had to call Heather (Carrie&#8217;s friend) to remind me to NOT blow it and give her the ring tonight. She told me &#8220;We&#8217;re going to treat this like drug rehab &#8211; if you feel yourself slipping, just CALL ME.&#8221;

I talked to Chris &#8211; he is going to pick up the ring tomorrow and put it in the safe at his sister&#8217;s house. This way not only will it be somewhere else&#8230;but somewhere that I can&#8217;t even get to.

This is ricockulous.
