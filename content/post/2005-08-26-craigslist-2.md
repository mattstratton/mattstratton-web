One thing I have to say for the Craigslist personals&#8230;they&#8217;re the only system I&#8217;ve ever done where GUYS actually get replies. Plus, they&#8217;re free.

I put up a new ad last night, and here are three of the girls who replied who I think are cute (this is friends-locked, so I figure it&#8217;s safe.)

_The girl who answered me is the one on the left. She seems pretty cute.
  
She&#8217;s a Cubs fan and seems nice enough. We&#8217;re going to meet for a drink
  
next week._

_This girl sent the best reply. It was long and involved and interesting. I also think she&#8217;s the cutest of the three._

_She&#8217;s the one on the right. She&#8217;s an
  
assistant at a law firm. We chatted
  
today on IM, and even though
  
she lives in the burbs, we seemed
  
to get along okay, but nothing
  
terribly thrilling jumping out._

So that&#8217;s the latest update in the wacky world of Craigslist. I also got a reply from a 22 year old girl, immediately followed by a reply from a 40 year old. So I seem to appeal to all generations.
