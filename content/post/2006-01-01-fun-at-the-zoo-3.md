Carrie and I decided to spend New Year&#8217;s Day at the Brookfield Zoo. The weather wasn&#8217;t too chilly, which helped immensely. It&#8217;s always interesting to see how animals act differently in different seasons. Of course, it helped that we found out that today was &#8220;free admission day&#8221; (although we discovered that when we arrived). I had a great time taking pictures of various animals.

The rest of the pictures can be found [here][1].
