&#8230;for my annual Get Irritated at Gentiles Rant

It kind of frost my chaps (or whatever Dallas would say) when someone wishes me a Happy Hannukah, if nothing else than 9 times out of 10 it is a gentile who thinks Chanukah is a big deal. Chanukah is a middlin&#8217; holiday that has the misfortune of falling at the same time as Christmas, so the gentile world thinks it&#8217;s a Big Deal Jew Day. Or Days.

It&#8217;s kind of like wishing a Christian &#8220;Happy fifth Sunday after Pentecost&#8221;. It&#8217;s not a big deal.

Having grown up as a Jew, I know that all Chanukah meant to me was some chocolate coins, candles, new socks, and on the 8th night, a clock pen.

In fact, there are schools of rabbinical thought that would rather see Chanukah \*not\* celebrated, as it commemorates a military victory and that&#8217;s not a really nice thing.

Although it reminds me of the old saw about Jewish holidays &#8211; they can all be summed up thusly: &#8220;Someone tried to kill us. They didn&#8217;t. Let&#8217;s eat.&#8221;
