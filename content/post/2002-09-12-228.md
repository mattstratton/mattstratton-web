I had a phone interview today for a job as a Microsoft Backoffice architect (basically, what I did at Heller).

I thought it went horribly. I barely could answer any of their questions. But I guess it went well&#8230;they&#8217;re bringing me in for an in-person interview tomorrow.

So tonight I&#8217;ll be going to Walgreens to get the stuff to dye my hair back to brown. Sigh. I better get this freakin&#8217; job then.
