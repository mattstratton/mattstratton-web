If you received an email from Reunion.com claiming &#8220;Matt is looking for you&#8221;, I cannot apologize enough. The bastards scraped my address book and sent those messages without my approval (I thought it was like LinkedIn, where it would load them and then let you opt-in to sending the messages).

If you did NOT receive any of these messages from me, consider yourself warned that clearly Reunion.com is a dangerous site (my cousin reported that he received an address book scraping Trojan from them before) and I warn against doing business with them or even visiting their site as they appear to be purveyors of malware and sketchy business practices.

I&#8217;m terribly embarrassed. I&#8217;m supposed to be savvier than this.
