This is a weird day.

I&#8217;ve been home all day, working for some of it, and watching TV for most of it. Occassionally napping.

I&#8217;ve seen every single page on the entire webbernet.

I have read every single thread on every single discussion board.

I&#8217;m so very bored. Tomorrow will be fun though.

It&#8217;s so&#8230;.quiet.
