[Dunder and Dwightning][1]
  


> If you&#8217;re working 9 to 5  
> And can&#8217;t get out alive  
> Just meet me in the breakroom in 10  
> We&#8217;ll hang out, hiding from the boss  
> And pray our paths don&#8217;t cross  
> I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re on the lam  
> You&#8217;ll say &#8220;Hello, Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.&#8221;</p>
It&#8217;s a hilarious song, but it&#8217;s also super catchy. [These guys][2] rule.
