  - Yes, I even get up early to do my workouts on weekends. Although I sleep in a few extra minutes, since I don’t have to get to work…but Henry and Joey still get up at about the same time, so I can’t sleep in TOO long. This morning I rocked out Kenpo X, which is the P90X workout that a lot of folks claim is the easiest…but that doesn’t mean it is EASY. At least not to uncoordinated folks like myself.

Yes, I even get up early to do my workouts on weekends. Although I sleep in a few extra minutes, since I don’t have to get to work…but Henry and Joey still get up at about the same time, so I can’t sleep in TOO long. This morning I rocked out Kenpo X, which is the P90X workout that a lot of folks claim is the easiest…but that doesn’t mean it is EASY. At least not to uncoordinated folks like myself.

## Workout Summary

Kenpo X is a martial arts/karate oriented cardio workout. It’s a lot of punches and kicks…okay, fine, it’s ALL punches and kicks. And some blocks. In between each round, there is a break. My goal during the break is to do all of the jumping jacks (20 seconds worth) and the ten “X Time” jumps that Tony does.

I continued to accomplish that this morning, as well as gain a little bit more height in my kicks. One change this week &#8211; I didn&#8217;t shut the curtains of the patio door, so I had a bit of a reflective surface to see myself in, and I can see that my form is NOT as good as I might have hoped. Gives me something to work on going forward.

## One more thing

You might remember that yesterday I found out that while doing Wall Squats, I managed to put a dent/crack in our family room wall. Here’s what THAT looks like.

So needless to say, I&#8217;m going to be spending some time on Angie&#8217;s List today looking for a drywall dude.

_Inspired by [Tori][2], I have decided to do daily blog posts about my P90X workouts. I have also created a specific RSS feed for just my [P90X posts][3], for those of you who are only interested in that (it will include my weekly wrap-up posts as well). This feed can be subscribed to by clicking [here][4]. Please let me know what you think of these daily posts or any feedback you might have about my workouts in the comments!_
