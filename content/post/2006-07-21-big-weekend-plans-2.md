Tonight Carrie and I are joining her friend Heather at Soldier Field for the Bon Jovi concert.

Hey, it&#8217;s what Heather wanted for her birthday. 

Then, this weekend, we&#8217;re off to Warren Dunes to do a night of camping with [Angie][1] and Brian. Looks like the weather will hold out for us, too. Sweet.

This picture has nothing to do with my post, but it&#8217;s the highest level of &#8220;interestingness&#8221; of my whole collection on Flickr. So I thought I&#8217;d post it. Because, as you may recall, I&#8217;d decided to post at least one picture in every LJ entry. And as you can see, I didn&#8217;t quite do that every time. I suck at the internet.
