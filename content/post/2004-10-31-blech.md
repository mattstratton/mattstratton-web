I have the Sonic Death Flu, Redux.

It hit me really hard last night.

I am fucking miserable.

My downstairs neighbor has been having a party all day. They are blasting &#8220;spooky&#8221; music REALLY. FUCKING. LOUD. But I am not going to complain because, frankly, they are good neighbors. However, if it&#8217;s still going on at 10 PM I \*will\* complain because I am sick.
