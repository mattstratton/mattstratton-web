Someone asked me, &#8220;When betting, do you bet based upon what you have now, or what you might end up with?&#8221; And I said &#8220;Well, you have to figure the probability of getting what you&#8217;re trying to get. And weigh that risk against the potential gain.&#8221;

It&#8217;s actually more applicable than I had thought.

What you do is look at the risk. And if the risk outweighs the potential gain, then it&#8217;s not a good bet

It&#8217;s not about only doing what is probable. You can take longer odds if the risk to gain ratio is right.

For example&#8230;if the odds of you drawing the winning hand are 1 in 100, and the pot is only fifty bucks, and it will cost you ten bucks to stay in&#8230;then you should fold/

To put that in relationship parlance&#8230;if there&#8217;s someone you think is kind of cute and interesting, but the odds of it working out are really low, and if it did work out, it would be kind of &#8220;eh&#8221;, and it is going to require a lot of effort to make happen&#8230;you fold.

But let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s someone you totally dig and you think they might like you. You aren&#8217;t sure, but if they DID like you, you know it could really be something big and great, and all you have to risk is just asking them out&#8230;then man, you go in on that pot!
