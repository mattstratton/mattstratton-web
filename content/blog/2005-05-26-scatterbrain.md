I&#8217;m a moron.

I thought I&#8217;d be a sport and upgrade Chris and I to first class for our flight home from Philly on Monday. I had enough miles to upgrade myself, and I have a free upgrade coupon from United.

Well, at work this morning, I realized that I had left the coupon at home. You need to show the coupon when you board, even if you&#8217;ve given them the number already, booked, etc. So I called United, and said &#8220;you know what&#8230;just bump us back down to coach.&#8221;

They can&#8217;t. The flight is full. So the only way Chris and I were gonna get home from Philly was in first class.

So I&#8217;m back home, just so I could pick up that stupid little piece of paper. Meeting Chris to head to the airport in an hour, and then the Atlantic City madness begins!
