My new laptop for work is in the &#8220;approval&#8221; phase. Hopefully it will go through, although I&#8217;m sure it will take a LONG time (it has to go up about five levels above MY boss to get approved). Here&#8217;s what my boss ordered for me:

[Dell Latitude D620][1]
  
Intel® Core™ 2 Duo T7200 (2.00GHz)
  
14.1 inch Wide Screen WXGA+ LCD Panel
  
2.0GB RAM
  
256MB NVIDIA® Quadro NVS 110M TurboCache™
  
100GB Hard Drive
  
Bluetooth
  
24X CD-RW/DVD
  
Wifi
  
17&#8243; external flat-panel monitor

Considering my current laptop has 512 MB of RAM and is a 2.20 GHz Mobile P4, this should be quite the boost.
