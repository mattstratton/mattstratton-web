I just got a call about the Bank One gig&#8230;no offer yet. But &#8220;initial feedback&#8221; is very positive. I guess they told the account manager that I was the best fit that they&#8217;ve seen so far. The recruiter expects that I&#8217;ll get an offer today, possibly even this morning.

Too much tension!
