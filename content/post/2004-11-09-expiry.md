My paid account is about to expire.

I can&#8217;t re-up just now because my Paypal is tied to my old bank account, and my new one isn&#8217;t set up, etc, etc. It&#8217;s a whole issue.

Anyway, I&#8217;m sure if I was a [camwhore][1] someone would re-up me. But I&#8217;m not. Oh well. Time for slow LJ again.
