So just because [Megan Morrone][1] and Leo Laporte are big TV stars on [TechTV][2] and shit, they think they can take over the world!

Take over the world for me! Just click on the little mappy thingy and you will claim part of the world in the name of Mugsy! Do it for love, life, and Cheezit brand cheese-flavored crackers.

**NOTE! You need to do the clicky clicky from my [main blog page][3] or else the &#8220;credit&#8221; goes to livejournal.com.**
