This is two week&#8217;s in a row with &#8220;hat&#8221; pictures, but I do so love that chapeau.

I snapped this picture before Carrie and I headed over to a &#8220;Coming To America&#8221; surprise party to celebrate Carrie&#8217;s friend Jayme&#8217;s boyfriend just moved to the States from the UK. The coat was part of my awesome score of the day at Carson&#8217;s; I picked up three sport coats for a grand total of $220. Carrie told me not to wear the hat to the party as it was &#8220;too 80&#8217;s&#8221;, so I decided to include it in my self-portrait just for fun.

Picture was taken with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50D-15-1MP-Digital-Body/dp/B001EQ4BVI%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001EQ4BVI" target="_blank">Canon 40D</a> with the Canon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009R6WT?ie=UTF8&tag=straigeyefort-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00009R6WT" target="_blank">24-70mm 2.8L lens</a>. I color-corrected it in Adobe Camera Raw, and then played with it in Photoshop &#8211; this is my favorite Kelby trick of having an Overlay layer over a desaturated layer &#8211; and then adding noise.

The best part of this was taking in in my front yard; I had my camera all set up on the tripod, and I have no idea what passing drivers thought I was doing.
