If you feel like keeping track of my riding, you can do so super easily by visiting my bike journal at <a href="http://www.bikejournal.com/journal_public.asp?rname=mattstratton" target="_blank">http://www.bikejournal.com/journal_public.asp?rname=mattstratton</a>.

Today&#8217;s ride home sucked ass, by the way. Super windy along the lake, and rainy to boot. I learned the following things about riding in the rain:

* I need fenders on my bike. I had mud all up the back of my shirt
  
* I need gloves if I am going to ride in the rain. My hands kept slipping off the handlebars towards the end.
  
* I need some kind of raingear.

That is all. Now I&#8217;m home in my nice, dry apartment. Sweet.
