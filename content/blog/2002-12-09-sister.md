I am always amused when my 19 year old sister imparts wisdom to me.

This is from an email she sent me on my birthday:

_&#8220;I think it&#8217;s really cool that you are around more. I know mom loves it. She loves you a lot&#8230;.probably more than you&#8217;ll ever realize.&#8221;_

Hehehe.

In related news, it turns out there is nothing wrong with her heart. Now they think it might be her thyroid. Or maybe she&#8217;s just in really, REALLY good shape (she has a resting pulse of 40).
