Had a fun time at our softball game picnic action. Incredibly light turnout &#8211; 20 people replied &#8220;yes&#8221; on the Evite, and out of that, about 6 showed up. Lucky that the kickball players stuck around after or it would have been a pretty sad game indeed.

I ended up not getting injured, which was good, although I did run really hard into the backstop, bounced off, and landed on my back. I was heartily amused.
