So I just read that you can <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/" target="_blank">download</a> iTunes 4.5 now for the Mac. Actually, maybe they have it for Windows too. I&#8217;m not sure.

Here&#8217;s what appears to be the new features in 4.5 (I assume it&#8217;ll show up in Software Update in the next day or two):

* Some free music downloads from the iTMS

* **iMix** &#8211; I guess this lets you upload your mix cd&#8217;s track listings to iTMS so other folks can check &#8217;em out.

* Music Video section on iTMS revamped

* Radio Charts on iTMS &#8211; pretty neat&#8230;I don&#8217;t know what they use to calculate this, but you can browse to your favorite <strike>ClearChannel Whorehouse</strike> radio station and see/buy tunes that they play

* &#8220;Party Shuffle&#8221; &#8211; I guess this is just a one-click approach to dynamic playlists&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure what the difference is between using Party Shuffle and just putting the whole playlist on &#8220;shuffle&#8221;&#8230;.but anything with the word &#8220;party&#8221; in it must be fun, right?

* Jewel case/insert printing for burned CD&#8217;s

* Lossless encoding &#8211; for all of you FLAC lovers

* WMA importing

Enjoy!
