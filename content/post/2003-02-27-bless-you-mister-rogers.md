It&#8217;s such a good feeling to know you&#8217;re alive.
  
It&#8217;s such a happy feeling: You&#8217;re growing inside.
  
And when you wake up ready to say,
  
&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll make a snappy new day.&#8221;
  
It&#8217;s such a good feeling, a very good feeling,
  
The feeling you know that we&#8217;re friends.
