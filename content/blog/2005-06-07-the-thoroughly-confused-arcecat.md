Just got this PM from our dear friend Arcecat (non-dancers, feel free to ignore)

<span style="font-style:italic;" class="postbody">I know you weren&#8217;t at DLX but you do seem to know people who were there&#8230;.I&#8221;m just so confused&#8230;.you know how they were having a wedding for Wombat and Snoopykiss&#8230;.I thought that was a mock gay wedding but then they went all out for it..so I&#8217;m just so confused&#8230;if they aren&#8217;t gay then really it was rather rude to do that cause that would seem to make a mockery of gay weddings then at the same time if they are gay and this was a real gay wedding then I should congratulate them&#8230;but I think they are straight ..but I&#8217;m just so confused&#8230;.</span>
