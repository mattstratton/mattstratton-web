Passed today&#8217;s exam:
  
070-646 Windows Server 2008, Server Administrator

I have two more tests to go &#8211; one one Wed and one on Thur. I&#8217;m not sure what certification this exam got me, but if I pass the next two I will be a MCITP &#8211; Microsoft Certified IT Pro (there&#8217;s no such thing as MCSE in 2008).
