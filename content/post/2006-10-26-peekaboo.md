So I just signed up for a gym membership with Crunch (found out my company has a pretty darn good discount deal with them), and was looking at the various locations in Chicago (I&#8217;ll be going to the one at Chicago and Orleans, incidentally).

Well, a few of the locations (not the one I will be going to) list &#8220;Peekaboo Showers&#8221; as an &#8220;amenity&#8221;. Intrigued, I did some googling, and discovered that they are [exactly what they sound like][1]:

> As you ascend the steps from the reception area, the walls of the staircase are made of the translucent glass that forms one wall of the showers inside. This setup is designed to let you watch the glorious curvy silhouettes of the hardbodies who work out at the gym bending their arms in semi-erotic stances sudsing themselves up to re-enter the world after a vigorous workout. 

That&#8217;s just crazy. Any of you ever seen something like this?
