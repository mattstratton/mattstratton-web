I have an interview this afternoon with AON.

It&#8217;s for a server engineer position; it would mean a) some more money, b) more interesting work, and c) about seven minutes shorter commute.

The odds are pretty good, I think&#8230;they are interviewing 6 people for 5 jobs. So if I don&#8217;t get it, I will feel like a big loser :)
