It&#8217;s back again. I don&#8217;t except to be invited to everything any of my friends do, but every now and again, there&#8217;s something big that everyone else goes to, and I hear about it, but am not invited.

I&#8217;m sure I do the same thing to other people without realizing it, so I shouldn&#8217;t get upset. And I know a lot of you reading this are going to be happy to sit there and judge me for being upset about this, but I&#8217;m used to that.

Anyway.
