CUYAHOGA FALLS &#8212; A member of Ohio&#8217;s 5694th National Guard Unit in Mansfield legally changed his name to a Transformers toy.

Optimus Prime is heading out to the Middle East with his guard unit on Wednesday to provide fire protection for airfields under combat.

&#8220;On Sunday, we were awarded as the best firefighting unit in the Army National Guard in the entire country,&#8221; said Prime. &#8220;That was a big moment for us.&#8221;

Prime took his name from the leader of the Autobots Transformers, which were popular toys and a children&#8217;s cartoon in the 1980s.

He legally changed his name on his 30th birthday and now it&#8217;s on everything from his driver&#8217;s licence, to his military ID, to his uniform.

&#8220;They razzed me for three months to no end,&#8221; said Prime. &#8220;They really dug into me about it.&#8221;

&#8220;I got a letter from a general at the Pentagon when the name change went through and he says it was great to have the employ of the commander of the Autobots in the National Guard.&#8221;

Prime says the toy actually filled a void in his life when it came out.

&#8220;My dad passed away the year before and I didn&#8217;t have anybody really around, so I really latched onto him when i was a kid,&#8221; he said.
