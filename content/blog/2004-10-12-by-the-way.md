For all of you bitching that you &#8220;only&#8221; got ten dances at Y6A&#8230;that&#8217;s ten more than I got.

I didn&#8217;t dance AT ALL. Now, before you make with the snarky comments, despite popular opinion, I do like to dance sometimes. And I wanted to do it a couple times this weekend.

But it didn&#8217;t work out. I blame myself.

No, I take that back.

I blame Nando. :)

In all seriousness, here&#8217;s what happened:

Friday night &#8211; hot and crowded. Didn&#8217;t dance for these reasons. Didn&#8217;t go to the late night, because still recovering from AC. Figured &#8220;hey, I&#8217;ll dance on Saturday night&#8221;.

Saturday night &#8211; crowded, and I was drunk. Pretended to dance with Shana for about ten seconds until she got irritated. Figured &#8220;hey, I&#8217;ll dance on Sunday night&#8221;.

Sunday afternoon &#8211; park was beautiful and music was great. I was cold because for some reason I believed Larry when he said it was &#8220;nice out&#8221;. Played with Larry and Roberta&#8217;s dog. Figured &#8220;hey, I&#8217;ll dance later tonight&#8221;.

Sunday night &#8211; arrived at venue with splitting headache due to contact lens imblance and major sushi coma. Barely able to talk to people, much less dance. All of a sudden, Tom and I head home. Figured &#8220;hey, I&#8217;ll dance next year&#8221;.

The end.
