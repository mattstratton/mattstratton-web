So I&#8217;m talking to Gaga Girl #2 (she&#8217;s the local one)&#8230;.

And, as usual, I get to consult on relationship advice with someone I am interested in.

It&#8217;s really a tough spot to be in. But I honestly think I&#8217;m giving her good advice. This fuckin&#8217; guy better thank me.

Not that she&#8217;s in a relationship with this guy. It&#8217;s just someone she is interested in. And I&#8217;m giving her advice on how to pursue him.

I need to not be such a pussy and take a risk and ask this girl out. If only I had a job. Or some stones.
