Carrie and I are having a one hour layover in the Atlanta airport waiting for our final plane to take us home from playtime.

Today we bought discount tickets to Typhoon Lagoon and played in the wave pool and on some water slides. My favorite was the &#8220;Crush and Gusher&#8221;, and I even did the super-fast straight-down water slide that I&#8217;ve always been scared of (it was kind of fun). We had lunch at Downtown Disney and then were off to the airport.

We had a great trip, and I should have more photos up on Flickr soon. Tomorrow it is back to reality &#8211; well, sort of. Carrie has to go back to work, but I am going to a Microsoft launch event instead of going into the office, so I don&#8217;t have to face true reality until Wednesday.
