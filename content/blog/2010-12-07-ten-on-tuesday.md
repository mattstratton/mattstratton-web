[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6183" title="tiltuesday5" src="/wp-content/uploads/tiltuesday5.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="296" />][1]Since I really should be posting in my blog more, I am doing this Ten on Tuesday post, inspired by <a href="https://stateiamin.com/?p=1565" target="_blank">my pal Erin</a>.

**1. What do you order at Starbucks?**

Without fail, I order a grande mocha, skim, no whip. The only exception is the occasional peppermint mocha during holiday time (especially when the Bucks is doing their BOGO deal).

 **2. Where is your favorite place to eat breakfast?**

Meli Cafe in Greektown. Close second is the world-famous Golden Apple diner.

**3. Are you on Twitter? Why or why not?**

Absolutely. I don&#8217;t tweet nearly as much as I used to, but I&#8217;m still an active follower. It&#8217;s just a delicious way to absorb quick hits of fun information and updates without having to actually invest any real time. My twitter name is <a href="https://twitter.com/mattstratton" target="_blank">@mattstratton</a>

**4. What is your favorite Christmas movie?**

<a class="zem_slink" title="A Muppet Family Christmas" rel="imdb" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251282/">A Muppet Family Christmas</a>. I have to thank my wife for introducing me to this amazing movie. It&#8217;s completely silly, and represents everything about the Muppets that makes me laugh. My wife and I probably quote from this movie at least weekly, and Kermit&#8217;s &#8220;The heck you say&#8221; phrase is a staple of my lexicon.

**5. Are you a good gift giver?**

I would say I bat about .500 with gift giving. Sometimes I can be really amazing, but if I get pressured to come up with something, I have been known to totally choke.

**6. Do you like your handwriting? Bonus points for posting a picture.**

My handwriting is terrible. I would blame our modern technology that keeps me from ever having to write anything, but it&#8217;s been bad since 1984 or so, and I didn&#8217;t have that excuse. My father is a doctor, so I like to claim that I have inherited his handwriting&#8230;funny thing is, my handwriting actually does look a lot like his. Although my mother has perfect penmanship, so I suppose that just means that the &#8220;bad handwriting&#8221; gene is dominant.

**7. Is your signature legible? Bonus points for posting a picture.**

Not in the slightest. This photo is of my most recent driver&#8217;s license:

**8. Have you ever been to New York during Christmas season?**

I have&#8230;twice. That is, I&#8217;ve been to NYC for my birthday two different times (once was in 2000, the other was in 2005). Although both times, it was super quick and I don&#8217;t remember much about the Christmas type things.

**9. Are there any items that you are completely brand loyal?**

Canon, when it comes to cameras. I&#8217;m also really brand loyal to Coke, although I do enjoy the odd diet Wild Cherry Pepsi sometimes.

**10. Who is your favorite public speaker?**

These days, I really love Steve Ballmer. While I don&#8217;t always agree with what he has to say, the guy is really genuine when he speaks. I saw him speak at the SharePoint conference last year, and the Gartner Symposium this year, and both times I was really engaged.
