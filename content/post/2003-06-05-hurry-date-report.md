So last night I went to a Hurry Date party, because my [friend the host][1] insisted I do so.

It was really kind of interesting. Showed up, was given a nametag on which I wrote my name and number (&#8220;57&#8230;like the ketchup&#8221;). All the gals sat at various tables around the room, and the guys would rotate. You got three minutes with each girl, and then afterwards, you marked &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; on a little scorecard next to her number. The theory being that after you go home, you log on to the website and punch in your results. If you and the girl both said &#8220;yes&#8221; to each other, you can then contact each other through the website to set up a second date. Neat idea.

The night was definitely slanted towards the fellas last night&#8230;there were more woment than men, and the girls were better looking than the guys. A lot of the girls were [Trixies][2], but some were really interesting. A few of them didn&#8217;t even live in the city, but were just visiting for a month or so&#8230;so that was interesting.

Problem is, since I was a &#8220;walk in&#8221; I didn&#8217;t create an id for the website when I &#8220;registered&#8221; (because I didn&#8217;t register, I walked in). So I can&#8217;t figure out how to create an id to log my matches. I have emailed their tech support and left a voice mail, with no response. Oh well.

Couple memories&#8230;it got a lot more fun towards the end, when I&#8217;d had three gimlets in me. The last &#8220;date&#8221; I had, the two of us decided to just invent fake backgrounds for ourselves. That was fun. And with one of the girls (a very cute blonde) we gossiped about the other people at the party. The was a cute brunette from NYC who looked like Sarah Silverman, and was really funny&#8230;but she&#8217;s only here for a few months for work. But alas, unless Hurry Date gets their shit together and gets me a login, we will never find out what these girls think.

Would I do it again? Probably not, unless Kitty gets desparate and offers to buy me a drink if I do. Would I recommend it for other people? Sure. It was fun, and not without its charm.
