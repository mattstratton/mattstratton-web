As most of you know&#8230;I&#8217;ve involved with a fun little website called <a href="http://straighteye.com" target="_blank"><b>Straight Eye for the Queer Shows</b></a>.

Well, we need a logo. Both for our website and for maybe some SE t-shirts (the site is horribly popular, and pretty soon we&#8217;re going to need to pay for bandwidth).

If you come up with a cool Straight Eye logo/t-shirt design, and we pick yours&#8230;we&#8217;ll give you a free t-shirt. Please note that it cannot include any of Bravo&#8217;s copyright material, such as &#8220;Queer Eye&#8221; or their logo. But you can use pictures of the four of us if you&#8217;d like.

Either post them here, or email me at [**[matt [at] straighteye [dot] com][1]**][1].

You guys rule.
