From <u>**[Pajiba][1]**</u>:

> _Must Love Dogs_ features dialogue seemingly written by many of the less-inspired online daters, who believe they can sum up their entire life with a series of bland adjectives (“Hi! I’m \___\___. I&#8217;m mature, caring, intuitive, sensible, compassionate, faithful, and honest. And I laugh a lot! Date me! For the love of God! Please. Pick me! Pick me ! I _need_ some stanky on my hang-low, _now!_”).
