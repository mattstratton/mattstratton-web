Just reading the manual for <a href="http://www.apple.com/dvdstudiopro/" target="_blank">DVD Studio Pro 2</a>&#8230;and in the chapter about creating subtitles, this is one of the examples:

00:00:12:04 , 00:00:14:12 , Lemurs are the bullies of the wild.
  
00:00:16:14 , 00:00:19:08 , Here we see them bring down a moose.

For some reason, I found that hysterical.

Incidentally, I don&#8217;t think any DVD that GTF puts out will have subtitles. They are a royal pain to create. I really wanted to put subtitles on our DVD, and then take the subtitle file and run it through <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com" target="_blank">Babelfish</a> to create &#8220;other language&#8221; tracks&#8230;but man, it could take forever.
