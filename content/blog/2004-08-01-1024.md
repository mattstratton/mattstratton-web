_Remember when you were in high school, and you really wanted to go to the prom with a gorgeous girl, but you couldn&#8217;t ask her because she was really popular and already had served two terms as president of the United States, so you wound up asking John Kerry? That&#8217;s the situation the Democrats are in now._
