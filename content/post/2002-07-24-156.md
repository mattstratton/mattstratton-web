I saw [this mug][1] and it made me think of [Trapper][2].

FYI, Trapper&#8217;s not gay. He&#8217;s just flaming. And queer.

Mugsy: question 1 &#8211; are you planning on going to late night events at wclx?
  
Trapper: i am not going to any events
  
Trapper: British virgin islands baby
  
Mugsy: oh right&#8230;you are going to that big gay retreat
  
Trapper: two words&#8230;. honey moon
  
Mugsy: that&#8217;s really kind of tacky to go on a homosexual island retreate when you should be on your honeymoon&#8230;
