So I came up with an idea today.

Actually, it was an idea I&#8217;ve had before, but really started thinking about today.

As you may or may not know (or care) there are about a gajillion different swing dancing discussion boards out there. So I was thinking it would be neat to create a web app that was a gateway to them all &#8211; you could create an account on the gateway, and then pick which boards you care about, and have a &#8220;portal&#8221; page to show you all the new topics and posts on those boards.

It could get pretty powerful; possibly incorporate something like the [Google Zeitgeist][1] to track trends in swing discussions, etc.

Since I&#8217;m going to have some downtime coming up, I might start playing with this next week.
