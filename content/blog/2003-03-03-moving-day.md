So this weekend was moving weekend&#8230;

Started on Saturday after doing some work down at JLA. Moved my computers into the new place to test out the wireless networking, which worked flawlessly. Went into the storage area in the basement to take my boxes and stuff out of Chris and Sarah&#8217;s storage locker. Fun fun.

Sunday was the big day. Mom came over to help me clean. While she washed everything down and did Mom-stuff, I moved the majority of my junk upstairs. Chris helped me with the couple of big things, and then Mom and I went shopping. She bought me some groceries, which was very nice of her. By the time I got home around 8 ish, I was beat.

It feels weird in the new place. I haven&#8217;t lived alone in about three years. I had to wander downstairs last night when I saw the kids get home from rehearsal because I missed them already :)

But the new place is shaping up! I&#8217;ll try to take some pictures tonight.
