So my friend and I used to come up with all sorts of new words. But I can&#8217;t remember most of them. So this is more for her, but any of you who remember them, post comments.

For example:

  * insteal &#8211; to install pirated software
  * ridiculate &#8211; to repeat a joke over and over again until someone finally laughs

What else?
