My monitor is pretty old; it&#8217;s a Samsun SyncMaster 700s, which I think I bought in, um&#8230;1997? It seems to work fine, except for when I try to calibrate. You know when you run a calibrating tool (like Apple&#8217;s Calibration Assistant, or Adobe Gamma), how one of the first things they tell you to do is, set the brightness all the way up, and then adjust the contrast until a grey object disappears into the black?

I never see the grey object, at ANY setting. I can&#8217;t help but think that this is making my output and working space look weird when I work in Photoshop.

Any ideas on things I can do to fix this?
