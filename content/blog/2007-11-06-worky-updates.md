Things have been busy this week, hence my lack of updates.

Yesterday was my first day of the new job. It&#8217;s been a little overwhelming, but in a (mostly) good way. I&#8217;ve been blindsided by people wanting to dump information on me, and I have a fancy new laptop. Still figuring out how to order myself a keyboard, mouse, docking station, and a second monitor though.

My BlackBerry hasn&#8217;t come in yet, so I haven&#8217;t ordered my business cards yet (since I don&#8217;t know what my cell number will be). This morning I got the long list of my new responsibilities, which are pretty crazy. I have a lot of stuff I now have to &#8220;approve&#8221;, since I&#8217;m a manager. I also found out that there are a lot of boring budgetary meetings I will &#8220;get&#8221; to attend. But the good news is everyone here is really nice. It&#8217;s also a very small, young, exciting company. I learned in orientation yesterday that the average age at this company is 34. That&#8217;s just crazygonuts.
