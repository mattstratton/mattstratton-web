Hey New Yorkers,

So, my girlfriend Carrie* has never been to New York. She&#8217;s always bugging me to take her, so I thought that it would be fun to take her for her birthday (which is March 4). She&#8217;s also been dying to see Avenue Q, so that works out well. It will be a SURPRISE, so please don&#8217;t make any comments anywhere online about this (this journal entry is filtered to my NYC friends only, and she can&#8217;t see it, so this is the ONLY place it can be discussed).

I wanted to make sure that people will be around that weekend (that it&#8217;s not Super Doubleplus Doofus Exchange 5 or something). Especially that Friday night &#8211; there&#8217;s a good chance that something pretty special will happen that night (but I can&#8217;t tell you what just now).

So let me know if you think you&#8217;ll be around &#8211; I&#8217;m not asking for a commitment, but more of a &#8220;testing the waters&#8221; thing.

Thanks!

* &#8211; for those of you who don&#8217;t know &#8211; Carrie and I started dating again in December, but we&#8217;ve been together (in one way or another) since October of 2003.
