What did I do last night? I got really really drunk in Manhattan to celebrate my birthday (along with some other December b-day pals). For some reason (after about the fifth Beam and Coke) I decided I should wear Cindy&#8217;s tiara.

FYI &#8211; I left the bar at 4 am, and was on a plane home 2 hours later. Ouch.
