So as you may recall&#8230;I got yelled at by my boss a while ago for using AOL IM at work.

So yesterday I get the following IM from him (we have an internal IM client called Sametime that also can talk to AIM)

**Mugsy&#8217;s Boss:** How do you reach AOL IM via sametime<br>
**Mugsy:** under people there is a link for log on to aol <br>
**Mugsy:** people menu that is <br>
**Mugsy&#8217;s Boss:** okay I have done that and logged in, how do I see people on AOL <br>
**Mugsy:** you have to add them<br>
**Mugsy:** like you add sametime folks<br>
**Mugsy:** except that the &#8220;community&#8221; is aol not sametime<br>
**Mugsy&#8217;s Boss:** okay, I don&#8217;t need to install AIM correct<br>
**Mugsy:** that is correct<br>
**Mugsy&#8217;s Boss:** thanks<br>
**Mugsy:** np<br>
**Mugsy&#8217;s Boss:** okay, I added a few ids. if they are online will it show ?<br>
**Mugsy:** it should<br>
**Mugsy:** just like in sametime &#8211; they will be green if online<br>
**Mugsy&#8217;s Boss:** do you have an AOL I could test with<br>
**Mugsy&#8217;s Boss:** I have tried this before, did not seem to work<br>
**Mugsy:** I removed it all but lauraann has one<br>
**Mugsy:** \***\***\***<br>
**Mugsy&#8217;s Boss:** it worked, thanks<br>
**Mugsy:** she just got an IM but she&#8217;s not sure it&#8217;s you<br>
**Mugsy&#8217;s Boss:** needs2climax<br><br>

Yup. He sent my female co-worker, (who also works for him) an IM from &#8220;needs2climax&#8221; (there are numbers in his IM name too, but I removed them, just like I starred out LauraAnn&#8217;s IM name).

Well, LauraAnn and I get a good laugh out of all this. The fella who sits next to me comes over to see what we&#8217;re laughing about. He just happens to be the Director of Internet Security Engineering for our company.

He was not amused. He officially requested a copy of the Sametime transcript from me. I just asked him that he not sell me out :)
