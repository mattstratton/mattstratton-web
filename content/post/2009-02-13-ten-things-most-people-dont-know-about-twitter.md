Most people on the webbertubes have, by now, heard of <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. You might even use it. But only the true, power-users of Twitter know these ten facts:

<ol style="margin-bottom: 3px;">
  <li>
    Nasa has been broadcasting tweets into space since 1972. The first one will reach Omicron Persei 8 in the year 2059.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have more than 50 tweets that contain the word &#8220;monetize&#8221; all future tweets are automatically marked with #annoyingdbag.
  </li>
  <li>
    All of <a href="http://twitter.com/feliciaday" target="_blank">@feliciaday</a>&#8216;s tweets are written by robots. Sexy, sexy robots.
  </li>
  <li>
    According to international law, once <a href="http://twitter.com/neilhimself" target="_blank">@neilhimself</a> reaches 1,000,000 followers he will be named Supreme President of the World.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are three companies who have a secret deal with Twitter that allows them to data mine all tweets for targeted advertising purposes. These companies are Microsoft, Haliburton, and whoever it is that sells the Snuggie.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the future, all resumes will have to be written in 140 characters or less.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is a law dating back to the late 1800&#8217;s making it illegal to use the term &#8220;tweeple&#8221; to refer to users of Twitter &#8220;in the presence of a person of the female sex&#8221; in Alton, Illinois.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you take the first character of the first fifteen tweets by <a href="http://twitter.com/wilw" target="_blank">@wilw</a> and re-arrange them, it spells out &#8220;I heart Wesley Crusher!&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://twitter.com/FakeSarahPalin" target="_blank">@FakeSarahPalin</a> was actually John McCain.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you tweet more than 10 times an hour, your name goes on a special list. You don&#8217;t want to be on that list.
  </li>
</ol>
