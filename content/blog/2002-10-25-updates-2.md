Some updates, in random order&#8230;

* Things are progressing apace with our Halloween party tomorrow. I know that we&#8217;re doing something right when just TALKING about our decorations creeps us out. Yay Halloween!

* More stuff moved into the new apartment. And Scooby (Chris&#8217;s dog) is the coolest ever. I love how dogs get excited about stuff. That&#8217;s why I like &#8217;em better than cats.

* Still haven&#8217;t done shit on my costume. That&#8217;s tomorrow&#8217;s adventure.

* Talked to Ben last night. Apparently he has &#8220;extensive notes&#8221; after viewing the rough cut; he and Mike are apparently of the opinion that the edit has to be completely done from the beginning. I need to see what they have to say; it&#8217;s quite an endeavor to do so, plus, I don&#8217;t know how much longer we&#8217;ll be welcome at Superior St&#8230;another six months seems pretty out of the question.

* Been re-reading Robert Rodriguez&#8217;s _Rebel Without a Crew_; it always serves to inspire me.</p> 

* Hippie Girl harped on me about smoking last night. I think that&#8217;s a sign.
