Inspired by <a href="http://worldsstrongestlibrarian.com/3636/guest-post-ultra-marathon-lets-get-stupid/" target="_blank">World&#8217;s Strongest Librarian</a>, Matt at <a href="http://www.lifewithoutpants.com/guest-blog-grand-tour/" target="_blank">Life Without Pants</a>, and Nick at <a href="http://www.sitesketch101.com/the-great-guest-post-marathon" target="_blank">Site Sketch 101</a>, I&#8217;m going to embark on a (hopefully) massive guest posting tour. Why would I do this? Well, I&#8217;ve found that I write better when someone gives me a topic. And since nobody&#8217;s really been asking me a lot of tech questions lately, I haven&#8217;t had anything to blog about.

## What&#8217;s the point of a guest post?

Guest posting is pretty cool. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://stackedblog.com/2009/04/07/the-big-switch-by-nicholas-carr/" target="_blank">written guest posts</a> for blogs such as <a href="http://stackedblog.com/" target="_blank">Stacked</a> in the past, and I personally think it turned out pretty well. It gives your blog a different voice for a day, which is good for you. And hopefully I send some traffic your way, since I&#8217;ll be posting about each guest post over here at Good Old Rock. As far as I am concerned, it&#8217;s beneficial since I might get some new readers from your blog &#8211; maybe someone who doesn&#8217;t read me already will start digging my vibe after reading my guest post over by you.

## How does it work?

If you would like me to write a guest post for you, please use the fancy-pants <a href="/contact" target="_self">Contact form</a> on my blog (available via the menu up-a-top) to send me a message. Make sure you include your email address, as well as the URL of your blog. I also need a topic. **I&#8217;ll write about anything you ask me to, but it will probably be a better post if it&#8217;s something I know at least a little about**. Topics relating to photography or technology will turn out better than if you ask me to write about politics or ferrets.

I will send the post to you via email &#8211; the only requirement I will have is that you include the one-paragraph bio/link that I will include in the post. Don&#8217;t worry &#8211; it won&#8217;t be dirty.

## When will this happen?

Time is going to be of the essence. As you may know, my lovely wife is pregnant with twins, and they&#8217;ll be coming in the new few weeks. That being said, starting next Tuesday, I&#8217;m going to be off from work for the rest of the year. While I fully realize that my &#8220;honeydew&#8221; list is going to be long, I should have time (and motivation) to write a bunch of guest posts for the folks who sign up. That being said, I reserve the right to cut off submissions at some point if I receive too many&#8230;or the boys come early.
