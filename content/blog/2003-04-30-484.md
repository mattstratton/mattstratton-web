Okay, I am pissed off now.

My boss just came by&#8230;apparently there is an opening on the team here. That is, as a full-time employee of the company. He was going to approach me and M\_____(the other contractor) about it.

Well, he just found out from HR that the company has capped any new hires from my company for the year.

But M\_____ works for someone else, so they are gonna offer it to her.

Which means there is no chance of me going perm until 2004 now.

That blows.
