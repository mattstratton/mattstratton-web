So I know you are down with .

But there&#8217;s also a thread on <a href="http://www.windyhop.org" target="_blank">Windyhop</a> called <a href="http://windyhop.org/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=10;t=002886" target="_blank">&#8220;The Geek World&#8221;</a>.

I am posted some of the best conversations from that thread here. The ones that are the funniest as well as the ones that you don&#8217;t have to be a Windyhopper to &#8220;get&#8221;.

Trapper: freakin linux
  
Trapper: Its sports a USB 1.1?
  
Trapper: See how gay linux is? Can&#8217;t even run USB 2.0
  
Mugsy: plus it has that rainbow-colored startup screen&#8230;
  
Mugsy: and I swear that KDE 1.2 has Tux in chaps on the desktop
  
Trapper: I bet Microsoft&#8230; created linux&#8230;. Linus Torvalds was the first robot powered by linux&#8230;
  
Trapper: and then, when linux overtakes microsoft, they will raise the curtain and send out a big FU to all the linux geeks&#8230;
  
Mugsy: and all will be laid to burnination

lindydallas: uhoh&#8211;the experimentalists on my floor are playing with the fusebox.
  
lindydallas: My computer could go off at any moment.
  
mugsy1274: dorks
  
mugsy1274: so much for that legendary linux uptime

lindydallas: It&#8217;s gonna be like the old days in here soon&#8211;doing computing by candlelight.
  
mugsy1274: uh&#8230;dallas?
  
lindydallas: yes?
  
lindydallas: movin&#8217; the electrons around by hand&#8230;
  
mugsy1274: hehhee
  
lindydallas: gettin&#8217; in, and throwin&#8217; tha switches&#8230;
  
lindydallas: yeah&#8230;
  
mugsy1274: picking up packets, bringing them downstairs manually&#8230;

lindydallas: Why, my great-grandfather used to be a packet handler for international business machines, back in the day.
  
lindydallas: They say he could bring a packet down 10 flights of stairs in just thirty seconds!
  
lindydallas: This was before elevators worked as fast as they do now, mind you.
  
lindydallas: He was a legend.
  
lindydallas: Worked till the day he died.
  
lindydallas: The young guys used to tell him that one day machines would do his job, and he just laughed.
  
lindydallas: How could a machine know where to take the packets, or run down the stairs?
  
lindydallas: It seemed ludicrous.
  
lindydallas: If he only knew&#8230;
  
lindydallas: And&#8230;. I&#8217;m done.

zeroxoneb: mkdir ~/src/tmp
  
lindydallas: Yes.
  
zeroxoneb: \****
  
zeroxoneb: wrong window
  
lindydallas: Mkdir away.
  
lindydallas: hehe
  
zeroxoneb: good thing i got &#8220;mkdir ~/pixmaps/kiddieporn&#8221; in the right window

lindydallas: That&#8217;s what I keep telling mugsy every time I see XP.
  
lindydallas: &#8220;It looks like candy&#8221;

mugsy1274: so 60 + 15 + 10
  
mugsy1274: 75
  
mugsy1274: right?
  
lindydallas: Uh&#8230; 85.
  
mugsy1274: oh that too
  
lindydallas: You just do network support, right?
  
mugsy1274: yes&#8230;the only math I know is powers of 8

mugsy1274: I don&#8217;t reboot my computer on a daily or weekly basis, fyi
  
lindydallas: hourly?
  
lindydallas: I&#8217;m so sorry.
  
lindydallas: how do you get any work done with your finger constantly on the reboot button?
  
mugsy1274: I type fast
  
lindydallas: and one handed, apparently

Mugsy: you&#8217;re a freak
  
Dallas: Indeed&#8230; but a freak with a running operating system.
  
Mugsy: ok freakboy&#8230;how much you gettin&#8217; paid to play wit&#8217; yo&#8217; linux?
  
Dallas: A DOLLAR.
  
Dallas: Wait&#8230; a DOLLAR FIDDY.
  
Dallas: Because I&#8217;m GOOD.
  
Dallas:
  
Mugsy: I choose to use microsoft not because I believe in their superiority&#8230;but because I can make the benjamins
  
Dallas: Your soul is worth that little, eh?
  
Mugsy: \****, beeyatch&#8230;if I worked supportin&#8217; a stable operatin&#8217; system, I&#8217;d never have shiznit to do, and wouldn&#8217;t get mah green on&#8230;
  
Dallas: Okay&#8230; I&#8217;ll give you that.

lindydallas: I {heart} the gimp.
  
mugsy1274: you should make your own open source mod of the gimp called the pimp
  
lindydallas: heehee
  
lindydallas: It would be easy&#8230;
  
lindydallas: Gimp stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program&#8230;
  
lindydallas: so it would be Pimp Image Manip. Program
  
mugsy1274: Or &#8230;
  
mugsy1274: Pinup Image Manip Program
  
lindydallas: heehee
  
lindydallas: I need to think of a modification to add.
  
mugsy1274: use The PIMP to make your own fake celeb porn!
  
lindydallas:
  
lindydallas: L O L
  
lindydallas: Need a &#8220;nekkidfy&#8221; option.

Trapper: i thought Unix and Java were made for each other&#8230;
  
Trapper: open source and all that \****&#8230;
  
Trapper: I feel like I am trying to mate a horse with a beetle

Dallas: linux doesn&#8217;t really &#8220;support&#8221; quicktime, so I know little about it.
  
Mugsy: that&#8217;s because you&#8217;re gay
  
Dallas: Well, my sexual orientation has little to do with my choice of an OS
  
Dallas: Or&#8230; does it?
  
Mugsy: www.linuxqueer.com
  
Dallas: That should be .org

Mugsy: like a precision workstation, 1.0GB processor, 256 MB ram, 40 gb hdd&#8230;$871
  
MisterC: 1.0GB processor?
  
MisterC: wtf is that?
  
Mugsy: it&#8217;s a one gigabyte processor
  
Mugsy: HUGE frontside cache on that mother\****er
  
MisterC: \****er. almost made me shoot Pepsi out of my nose

MissKitty: i can forward you some stuff now
  
MissKitty: if my connection will stop being stupid, that is&#8230;
  
Mugsy: you need to set the parameter correctly&#8230;change it to CONNECTION.STUPID = FALSE
  
MissKitty: though, since i&#8217;m on the web publishing portion of my html training, i know several options for WHY my connection could be stupid
  
MissKitty: my guess is that it is a stupid server
  
MissKitty: here at the university, we have two kinds of servers: stupid and stupidfey
  
MissKitty: normally, i am on a stupidfey server
  
MissKitty: this means i can typically access anything i want in a decent amount of time, but it may shut me out for no reason whenever it feels like it
  
MissKitty: apparently, today i have been switched over to the stupid server which was made in 1972 and is powered by turtles

Mugsy: they just released the newest version of gopher server
  
MisterC: hehe &#8220;Furry Terror&#8221;
  
Mugsy: we should create our own hierarchical information protocol
  
Mugsy: hamster://
  
&#8230;
  
MisterC: stupid gay \****ing websphere
  
MisterC: websphere shall feel my Furry Terror!
  
Mugsy: gophersphere!
  
&#8230;
  
MisterC: my machine is currently using 1,312,572,809 kb of memory
  
Mugsy: your machine sucks
  
Mugsy: if you were programming a site using gopher, you would not have such problems

Dallas: Man, ever since they did the OS upgrade on my linux machine, that thing goes down almost as much as a windoze box.
  
Dallas: Well, once a week&#8230; but still. That&#8217;s a lot.
  
Dallas: Cheap POS.
  
Mugsy: what have I been telling you? linux sux.
  
Mugsy: it just sux in an open, free way

Felicia: WHY does my switch have 5 ports if I can only use 4 of them? WHY? Moronic piece of \****!
  
Mugsy: one port is an uplink
  
Felicia: you&#8217;d think then they&#8217;d make all the ports functional though. It&#8217;s like having an extra cigarette lighter in your car that only works if the other one isn&#8217;t in use.
  
Mugsy: nope, not at all
  
Mugsy: it&#8217;s like expecting your cigarette lighter in your car to work as the dome light, since you don&#8217;t use a cigarette lighter

Mugsy: you know all those little icons down on the right by the clock? those are all programs running
  
Mugsy: and they get lonely when you don&#8217;t use the computer, so they connect to the internet to talk to their friends
  
Tracy: i would believe you if i didn&#8217;t think you were an idiot

Dallas: I&#8217;m running mozilla now (no more netscape)
  
Dallas: It&#8217;s nice.
  
Mugsy: good for you
  
Mugsy: will you be powering your computer with your sense of self-satisfaction?

Dallas: \_Everyone\_ knows that unix is INDESTRUCTIBLE!
  
Dallas: Yes!
  
Dallas: That&#8217;s it!
  
Dallas: It&#8217;s so hard to use that NO ONE can figure out how to break it, much less make it do something useful.

Dallas: I would like to know if namesecure does anything stupid&#8230;
  
Dallas: like send me mass emailings after I register
  
Dallas: or put popups when they forward, etc.
  
Dallas: How would I check something like that?
  
Mugsy: talk to someone who uses it
  
Mugsy: they don&#8217;t exactly advertise it
  
Mugsy: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
  
Mugsy: Does NameSecure annoy me with spam and popup ads?
  
Mugsy: At NameSecure, we consider spam emails to be a &#8220;value-added&#8221; service we provide at NO ADDITIONAL COST to you, the customer! Plus, the addition of popup ads on your forwarded URL make you look like a REAL e-commerce website that has had to resort to advertising to maintain a revenue stream!
  
Dallas: You&#8217;re \****in&#8217; KIDDING me.

Trapper: java objects keep leaking and sucking up all the available Ram and crashing the box
  
Trapper: for absolutely no good reason
  
Mugsy: see? Java literally sucks.
  
Trapper: it really does&#8230; why java people can&#8217;t see this, I&#8217;ll never know

Dallas: I could take a job as a UNIX Instructor!
  
Mugsy: unix is teachable?

Trapper: So here is another thing that pisses me off&#8230;
  
Trapper: Why is it that EVERY TIME someone figures out how to run linux on something, all the linux F*ckheads have to say how they need to run out and buy one.
  
Trapper: linux geek1: &#8220;I got linux running on my xbox&#8221;
  
Trapper: linux geek2: &#8220;I hate microsoft, but I guess I should go buy an xbox now!!!!&#8221;
  
Trapper: linux geek3: &#8220;Can I wack off while I watch you run linux on your xbox?&#8221;
  
Trapper: linux geek4: &#8220;me too! me too!&#8221;
  
Trapper: linux geek2: &#8220;I only buy american made cars&#8230; but if someone got linux running on their Honda Civic I would buy one in a second! And then rice it all out like Vin Desiel in that one movie with cool cars&#8221;
  
Trapper: linux geek4: &#8220;me too! me too!&#8221;
  
Trapper: linux geek3: &#8220;Can I wack off while I watch you run linux on your Honda Civic?&#8221;

Dallas: HAHA&#8230;. I just got the best alert message from mozilla.
  
Mugsy: &#8220;WARNING: You are running low on self-satisfaction. Please save your work, and post on Slashdot as soon as possible.&#8221;

Trapper: right now I am getting ready to join the millions of people in celebration of Black friday
  
Mugsy: gettin&#8217; yer shoppin&#8217; on?
  
Mugsy: dude, that&#8217;s what the internet is for
  
Trapper: so depending on whether or not I survive the terrorist attacks&#8230; we&#8217;ll see
  
Trapper: there is just something about being out there though&#8230; in the trenches
  
Mugsy: you make me sad
  
Mugsy: turn in your geekbadge
  
Trapper: dude&#8230; don&#8217;t judge me&#8230; I have already done 80% of my shopping online&#8230; we are just going downtown to see the lights and the people and the stores and sip our cappucinos and celebrate the consumerism that makes america grand.
  
Mugsy: ok, you don&#8217;t have to resign
  
Mugsy: but we&#8217;ll be watching you
  
Trapper: thank you
  
Trapper: you will be watching me with spyware?
  
Mugsy: try to at least work the word &#8220;elite&#8221; into your conversation today

Dallas: In unix, we don&#8217;t &#8220;name&#8221; our drives. That&#8217;s for people who can&#8217;t remember what they were doing.
  
Dallas: If you can&#8217;t remember /mnt/hda/, then you got issues.

Dallas: Man, so Devon gave me her palm IIIxe&#8230;
  
Mugsy: yah?
  
Dallas: I&#8217;m going crazy throwing \**** on it.
  
Mugsy: did you install linux on it yet?
  
Dallas: You&#8217;ll probably laugh&#8230;
  
Mugsy: you did
  
Mugsy: NERD!
  
Dallas: but I&#8217;ve got my eye open for a stable linux port.
  
Dallas: Nah, I&#8217;m still using palmos.
  
Dallas: though I did patch it.
  
Dallas: and put in a graphing calculator application
  
Dallas: and a game
  
Mugsy: which game?
  
Mugsy: &#8220;manually masturbate linus torvolds&#8221;?

Dallas: I don&#8217;t understand why the vending machines don&#8217;t have power.
  
Mugsy: do they run linux too?
  
Dallas: No, but the hotdog vendor does.
  
Dallas: That&#8217;s why \*he\* had chips.
