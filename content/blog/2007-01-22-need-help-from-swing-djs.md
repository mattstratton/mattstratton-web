&#8230;or anyone else who might have some ideas.

I&#8217;m looking for a very good version of &#8220;Love&#8221; &#8211; not too fast, with maybe a couple of cool breaks, and not the &#8220;usual&#8221; versions. If any of you have any ideas, please let me know.

Also, I need an idea for a song to dance with my mom. Again, swing, hopefully with a good &#8220;mother/son&#8221; theme, and not too fast.
