(I don&#8217;t have any good photos that correspond to biking, so there&#8217;s no picture in today&#8217;s entry. Sad.)

I haven&#8217;t updated in a while, so I figured it was a good time to do so.

Today is the second day this week that I&#8217;ve biked to work. Now that it&#8217;s not oppressively hot, I should be able to do this more often. My goal for next week is to ride all four days (I&#8217;m taking Monday off so that Carrie and I can go to Six Flags.)

I&#8217;ve been mixing my route up a bit. On Tuesday I rode home on the lakefront path instead of taking the streets. And this morning I rode that way in.

It adds a little over 3 miles to the commute (on streets it&#8217;s 6.9 miles, on the path it&#8217;s 10.7), but door-to-door it&#8217;s only about ten minutes longer (due to the fact that I can go faster on the path, plus there&#8217;s no stopping for most of the ride).

It&#8217;s definitely a great way to go home &#8211; as long as I leave work by 2:30 and miss all the jackasses strolling along the path four-abreast. It&#8217;s great to be able to scoot along at a faster clip without being interrupted &#8211; plus, there are much fewer girls in bikinis on Lincoln Avenue than at North Avenue Beach :)

On the way in it was a different story &#8211; much windier, so my average speed dropped from 15 mph to 9. Slowed me down a lot, but it was still fun.

Today I&#8217;m watching the weather &#8211; we&#8217;re supposed to get some pretty strong storms around 3 PM. So I figure if I leave work by 2, I should be safe. I don&#8217;t really want to ride home in high winds and torrential downpour!
