As you all know, I love <a href="https://www.flickr.com" target="_blank"><strong>Flickr</strong></a>. However, they don&#8217;t let you share videos. I&#8217;ve been poking around trying to find a good solution for video sharing, and the best I&#8217;ve found so far is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/signup.php?referer=mugsy1274" target="_blank"><strong>YouTube</strong></a>.

So far, the only thing I don&#8217;t like about it is that the only way to upload videos to it is via a web form &#8211; there&#8217;s no standalone client. I imagine that eventually that will change (a lot of the other video sharing sites, such as <a href="https://www.revver.com" target="_blank"><strong>Revver</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.streamload.com" target="_blank"><strong>Streamload</strong></a> have clients). I like YouTube because a) it&#8217;s free, and b) it&#8217;s pretty easy to use. Plus, it&#8217;s got the &#8220;community&#8221; aspect that I love about Flickr.
