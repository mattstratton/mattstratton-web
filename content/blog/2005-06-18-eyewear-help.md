So I&#8217;m down to my last right contact. This is a problem.

I tried ordering a box online last week, but when they called my eye doctor to &#8220;confirm&#8221;, the doc said my prescription had expired.

Anyone in NYC know of an eye doc who will sell me contacts without having to call the mothership first? I know my prescription and all that jazz. I suppose I could just go to a doc here and get an exam, but I really don&#8217;t feel like spending the money. Since when are contact lens prescriptions only good for a year? What a crock of stew.
