Given that it&#8217;s a slow weekend, blog-wise, I am just going to share with you today&#8217;s photo from my Picture a Day, aka Project 365.

[<img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3654/3579725547_692e417611.jpg" alt="10/365 - Staggering" width="500" height="315" />][1]

Today&#8217;s picture comes from our trip today to the Brookfield Zoo. This is the Crane family, made up of my friends Brian and Tracy and their son Sam.

This was not a posed shot (as is clear from Tracy&#8217;s closed eyes), and I took one right after with all of them looking at the camera, but I didn&#8217;t like it as much.

I cannot decide if this is a good photo or it looks like a snapshot. Thoughts?
