_For those of you not familiar…Fussy Follow Friday is based upon the concept that instead of a glut of Twitter follow recommendations, I will make one, and ONLY ONE, follow recommendation per Friday. For more information, the Library of Congress recommends <a href="../2009/06/10/fussy-follow-friday/" target="_self">this blog post</a>._

This week, we&#8217;re going to rock out on Fussy Follow Friday with the <a href="https://curiousillusion.com/2009/06/11/fussyfollowfriday/" target="_blank">co-founder</a> of <a href="https://search.twitter.com/search?q=+%233F" target="_blank">#3F</a>&#8230;**<a href="https://twitter.com/curiousillusion" target="_blank">@curiousillusion</a>**!

A fellow <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/curiousillusion/" target="_blank">Flickr addict</a>, photog, and <a href="https://curiousillusion.com" target="_blank">blogger</a>, Ari is one of my favorite people in the Twitterverse. Her tweets are personal but engaging. Despite the fact that we <a href="https://twitter.com/mattstratton/status/2520201616" target="_blank">differ on the meaning of the term &#8220;rawr&#8221;</a> (she interprets it as a growl of anger, while I see it as a sexy, cat-sound of appreciation), we still manage to be friends.

Ari is the one who inspired me to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mugsy/sets/72157618597916068/" target="_blank">fire up Project 365</a> (okay, well, so did <a href="https://jasondanielphotography.com/today/" target="_blank">Jason</a>, but he&#8217;s not on Twitter so he doesn&#8217;t count for this post). <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/curiousillusion/sets/72157612114211912/" target="_blank">Her own P-365</a> is amazing &#8211; she performs some truly incredible photography with limited gear. We&#8217;re all waiting impatiently for the day that she finally gets her dSLR and blows all of us out of the water.

So why should you follow <a href="https://twitter.com/curiousillusion" target="_blank">@curiousillusion</a>? One simple reason &#8211; she&#8217;s quite frankly, one of the more awesome people on Twitter. She will make your Twitter experience amusing, personal, and make you smile. Except when she uses the word &#8220;rawr&#8221; incorrectly. But maybe that&#8217;s just me. Also, she&#8217;s really trying to get to 500 followers today&#8230;good, quality followers, that is. And if you read my blog, you&#8217;ve GOT to be quality. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/curiousillusion" target="_blank">@curiousillusion</a> &#8211; and tell her @mattstratton sent ya!
