Past episode topics have included such things as SQL Server 2008, SOA, Windows Azure, and Silverlight.

This week&#8217;s episode was all about website scalability. My collegue Mike Tai and I talked with <a href="https://eraserandcrowbar.com/" target="_blank">Larry Clarkin</a> and <a href="https://blog.wadewegner.com/" target="_blank">Wade Wegner</a> about things like content delivery networks, load balancers, and .NET caching. If you&#8217;re into that kind of thing, I recommend giving the podcast a listen.
