I&#8217;m doing this because my friend did it and because I want all of you to do it so I can compliment all of you, Unlike Marcelo, though, I am totally fishing. But that&#8217;s fun too.

_One little compliment can make you feel amazing. So give me a compliment, anything in the entire world, even that my shoelaces are pretty. Put this in your journal. And once you get some comments, put that entry in a memory or tag and when you are feeling down, just go to that entry and this will remind how great you are._

Sidenote: I wish I had pretty shoelaces. I think.
