Partytom and I went to see _Soul Plane_ tonight.

I don&#8217;t know what we were expecting, but it was quite possibly the worst movie I&#8217;ve seen in a LONG time.

It had a couple amusing moments. But it was just&#8230;so&#8230;random. Nothing happened, and the humor was never really fully realized.

Blech.
