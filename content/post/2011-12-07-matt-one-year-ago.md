Every year on my birthday, I receive an email from myself, written the year before, via the <a href="http://www.futureme.org" target="_blank">FutureMe.org</a> service (hattip to my friend <a href="http://trappermarkelz.com/" target="_blank">Trapper</a> for giving me the idea several year ago).

I just received the letter from 2010. It&#8217;s interesting to review it, and see how things have changed in a year:

> Dear FutureMe,
> 
> Happy 37th birthday! Wow, you sure are getting old. I hope that 2011 was a great year for you. The boys are almost TWO YEARS OLD for you now&#8230;that blows my mind.
> 
> As a reminder, here are some of the things that happened to you almost exactly a year ago today (I&#8217;m writing this from Dec 8):
> 
> 1) You are in the middle of High Performance Management training from CV. Since it&#8217;s now a year later, have you been able to actually do anything with what you learned?
> 
> 2) Your wife is freaking out about the holidays and getting things ready for the boys&#8217; first birthday party. I hope it worked out well and everyone had a great time.
> 
> 3) You are going through RCIA at Old St. Pat&#8217;s. Do you remember what that was like?
> 
> 4) You&#8217;re getting ready to have a sit-down with your boss about career direction. Has anything changed in the year between?
> 
> 5) We are ALMOST about of beta for Redesign 5&#8230;and by the time you are reading this, 5.1 should be live as well. What does Apartments.com look like in Dec 2011?
> 
> 6) Becky and Eric will be married by now. How was their wedding?
> 
> Happy birthday, old man!
> 
> Past Matt

Looking at this letter, it reminds me of the fact that on my birthday last year, we had no idea that Sophia would be a part of our family and our lives. 2011 was a truly challenging year for me, but it was also a year filled with amazing changes.

This letter also helps me really think about what happened in the past year. As implied, I completed the RCIA journey at Old St. Pat&#8217;s &#8211; a process that was a very important part of my life for the first half of 2011! My sister-in-law, Becky, had a wonderful wedding this summer. And the boys had a great first birthday party.

It&#8217;s amusing to look at some of the work-related items&#8230;item 5 is really probably only of interest to my co-workers, but for those of you who do not work with me, the reason it is somewhat funny is that in 2011, we went through a massive change in our methodology (for the better), but it means that certain terms don&#8217;t make sense in our world any more. Agile, baby.

Happy birthday to me!
