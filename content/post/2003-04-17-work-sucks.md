So yesterday, my boss calls Marie and me over for an &#8220;emergency meeting&#8221;.

Turns out that the Powers That Be have decided to hand down a decree. Effective immediately, nobody can touch any server connected to the network between 6 AM and 10 PM.

That goes for EVERY server. Not just production. Even new servers that are being built, or rebuilding old servers that have been decommissioned.

So basically, it makes it impossible for us to do our job during the day.

My boss&#8217;s solution? Move Matt and Marie to third shift. He claims this willl &#8220;hopefully be for a week only&#8221; while they figure this out.

Well, the hits just keep on coming&#8230;apparently Marie is NOT being moved to third shift, since she&#8217;s doing break/fix stuff, which can be done during the day.

So starting Tuesday night, my hours will be 10 PM to 6 AM. And nobody else will be around.

This better only last a week or I&#8217;m gonna be PISSED!
