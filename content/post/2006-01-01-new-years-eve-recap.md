NYE was pretty low-key this year. Carrie and I went to dinner with some friends at Uncommon Ground (which was pretty good). Then we all went to see &#8220;Cupid Has A Heart On&#8221; at <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Improv Olympic</span> [IO Chicago][1]. That show is friggin&#8217; hilarious. You should all go see it. Cherie was there with some of her Second City friends as well.

After the show, Carrie and I went to a party that her friends Sarah and Jessie were hosting &#8211; we had a few drinks there, and then met up with Heather and Matt back at Carrie&#8217;s house to ring in the new year.

Good times.
