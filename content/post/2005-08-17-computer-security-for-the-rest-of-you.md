[][1] has been bugging me to put up a journal entry that talks about basic computer lockdown stuff, similar to my [Firefox post][2].

So here you go, Tracy.

 <span class="postbody">Best protection against spyware? DON&#8217;T INSTALL STUPID CRAP. Second best? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/">Ad-aware</a></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-Destroy/3000-8022-10289035.html?tag=lst-0-1">Spybot</a></span>. Run &#8217;em every now and again. Plus, installing the free <a class="postlink" href="https://toolbar.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Toolbar</a> will give you a free popup blocker that&#8217;s nice and helpful.</p> 

<hr />
Other things that will help protect you from the baddies on the Internet:</p> 

<p>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Firewalls</span> &#8211; the bad guys can&#8217;t phuck with your computer if they can&#8217;t get to it. Putting your broadband connected computer behind a router/firewall such as the <a class="postlink" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00004SB92" target="_blank">Linksys BEFSR41</a> not only lets you share a dedicated connection with multiple PC&#8217;s, but provides pretty good firewall protection. Another solution (which can be used in tandem with a hardware firewall) is a software firewall on the PC itself, such as <a class="postlink" href="https://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_za.jsp?lid=pdb_za1" target="_blank">Zone Alarm</a>. This also helps you realize when you&#8217;ve GOT a Trojan or something else nasty, because you&#8217;ll see it trying to reach out over the webbernet and do evil things.
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Software Updates</span> &#8211; Most baddies work by exploiting &#8220;holes&#8221; in existing software. Once these holes are discovered, the programmers quickly patch them up (sometimes), but it doesn&#8217;t do you any good if you don&#8217;t install the patches. <a class="postlink" href="https://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Windows Update</a> will keep your Microsoft operating system up to date &#8211; almost all of the major worms that have wreaked havoc on Windows users took advantage of a security flaw that was corrected by a patch at least a few weeks before the worm was released. If you&#8217;re up-to-date on your software, you&#8217;re a lot safer. Same thing goes for your anti-virus files; make sure you have that software set to update. AV programs can only detect viruses that they know about.
</p>

<p>
  Want to see how well your firewall is protecting you? Care to find out the gaping holes in your computer security? Visit <a class="postlink" href="https://grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2" target="_blank">Shields Up!</a> and run the tests there. If you pass &#8217;em all, you&#8217;re pretty darn safe.
</p>

<span class="postbody">It really does amaze me how many people fail to keep their antivirus defintions up to date (or don&#8217;t even run AV at all), or don&#8217;t keep their operating system patched.</span></p> 

<p>
  It&#8217;s like a car. It needs maintence. You take your car in when the &#8220;check engine&#8221; light goes on. You put gas in the car, and check the air in the tires. A computer is not a toaster.
</p>

<p>
  Also, if you have a broadband connection, please either put your computer behind a firewall or at least install something like ZoneAlarm or use the <a class="postlink" href="https://www.microsoft.com/WindowsXP/home/using/howto/homenet/icf.asp" target="_blank">firewall built into XP</a>. Ideally, you should be behind a router AND running a software firewall, but at least do one.
</p>

<p>
  Think about how foolish you would feel if someone broke into your house and vandalized your walls, stole your stuff, and used your phone line to call a bunch of 900 numbers, and when asked &#8220;did you lock your door?&#8221; you said &#8220;why should I have to?&#8221;
