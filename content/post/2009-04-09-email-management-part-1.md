Ah email. Such a necessary part of our life, both work and personal&#8230;and such a large drain on our time and energy. According to some estimates, over 180 billion email messages are sent a day. Granted, most information leads us to believe that approximately 75% are spam and viruses, but that still leaves us with over 4.5 billion &#8220;legitimate&#8221; emails to deal with. I don&#8217;t know about you folks, but I don&#8217;t have that kind of time.

There are various theories and processes for handling the glut of email that we deal with on a daily basis. Over the next few weeks, I will be dedicating the <a href="/topics/tech-tips/" target="_self">Tech Tips</a> to email management. Each week I will pick a different strategy, and follow it diligently &#8211; and then report on my experiences in a Tech Tip.

Based upon a recommendation from Good Old Rock reader <a href="http://twitter.com/mteson" target="_blank">@MarceloTeson</a>, I have decided to kick this off with <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero" target="_blank">Inbox Zero</a>, an email management process/lifestyle created by <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/" target="_blank">Merlin Mann</a>. As Marcelo described it to me, &#8220;the idea is that your inbox should be a true inbox &#8211; a receptacle for unread new messages, and your goal is for it to be empty.&#8221; In spirit, this reminds me a lot of **Getting Things Done** (which will be the strategy I cover after Inbox Zero). I&#8217;m excited to get moving with this project &#8211; according to <a href="http://www.xobni.com" target="_blank">Xobni</a>, I receive an average of 200 emails per day in my &#8220;work&#8221; email &#8211; I have no statistics on my personal Gmail yet. 

Come back next Thursday to see how my week of <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero" target="_blank">Inbox Zero</a> has come along. If you have any suggestions for other mail management strategies you&#8217;d like to see me review, leave them in the comments below.
