The City of Chicago is making my bank account sad today. I owe a bunch of parking tickets, so I decided to pay them online. So I go to the website, type in my license plate, and it says &#8220;Okay, deadbeat, you owe us this much money for your parking tickets. Click here to pay.&#8221;

I click there to pay. Type in my info. Then it says &#8220;We could not charge your card because the zip code was wrong&#8221; or whatever. &#8220;Click here to re-enter information&#8221;.

So I try my old zip code, thinking that might work. Nope. Zip code is still wrong. I click to try again.

I do this a total of four times. Never works.

Then I look at my online bank statement.

My &#8220;available balance&#8221; is $800 less than it was before I started that adventure. And I was paying $200 worth of parking tickets. Therefore&#8230;

THE FUCKING THING WENT THROUGH EVERY TIME.

And to add insult to injury&#8230;according to the website, my tickets are still unpaid.
