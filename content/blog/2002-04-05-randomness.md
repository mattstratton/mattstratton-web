Met with MK last night and we worked through a couple sticking points on her character. It was reassuring. Every day more pieces fall into place. Of course, each day more things get fucked up. I&#8217;m trying for equilibrium at this point.

The quicky mart downstairs did not have the muffin I wanted. I really wanted a bran raisin muffin. But nope. Only fat-free blueberry, cranberry, and &#8220;double chocolate chunk.&#8221; So I went with the fat-free blueberry. Why are only blueberry muffins made in a fat-free variant?
