Last night I showed my friend Lippy (a professional photographer) some of the pictures I took of my friends when I was visiting Atlanta.

He liked them! He told me what was good about the ones he liked, and what didn&#8217;t work about the ones he didn&#8217;t. That really made me feel good about it.
