was sad tonight as she regaled me with the story of how <a href="https://www.discotastic.com/" target="_blank">Disco</a> failed, years ago, to make a cute little icon of her for his <a href="https://www.discotastic.com/personal/pals.html" target="_blank">Pals</a> page.

I can&#8217;t allow this to go unchecked. And neither can you. We all know how powerful online petitions are. So sign this one!
