I was talking to my friend Samantha yesterday, and she asked me who the hottest girl was that I&#8217;ve ever dated.

I had to think about it, but realized that it would have to be Caroline, the girl I dated about five years ago. She was very pretty and quite hot, and we got along famously. The only problem was age. She is ten years older than I am (amusingly enough, when we first met I thought she was younger than I, and she thought I was older than her). She had a &#8220;thing&#8221; where she refused to &#8220;date&#8221; younger guys. So even though we were together for four months, didn&#8217;t see anyone else, and were sleeping together and had an implied weekend date, she never could call me her &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; or refer to us as &#8220;dating&#8221;.

She was weird. She has since moved to Virginia and gotten married.

Anyway, so Samantha asked me if I had a picture of her. I don&#8217;t. I have no electronic pictures of the two of us. But I did some Googling, and discovered that she&#8217;s in the IMDB for a bit part she played in a film in 1992.

Just funny is all.
