If any of you are Astros fans, you might as well let me know so I can take you off of my friends lists.

Lance Berkman is a fucking pussy. Even your local papers admit the ball didn&#8217;t hit him in the head. I bet he gets the Best Actor nod this year. Might make up for his lack of balls.

That being said, I don&#8217;t blame Berkman for the Cubs&#8217; loss yesterday. I blame Corey &#8220;I Drank Last Night&#8221; Patterson and the rest of the squad for just phoning in a game. Man, that&#8217;s the first time that I can remember leaving a Cubs game EARLY. Disgusting.
