OK, so I was just watching last night&#8217;s Malcolm in the Middle&#8230;and Fox had to interrupt the 30 minute show THREE TIMES with a FOX SPECIAL WEATHER BULLETIN WITH SUPER FANCY GRAPHICS to warn us all that there was a tornado watch.

Of course, normal networks do this with an overlay&#8230;and don&#8217;t interrupt AT SUPER CRITICAL COMEDIC MOMENTS FOR A BIG FATASS WEATHER JERKY.

That made me mad.

Second point &#8211; I know some of you are swordplay knowledgeable (I&#8217;m looking at \*you\*, ), and I&#8217;m curious as to the accuracy of the swordplay in _Kill Bill_. What do you think? Was the style well-represented?
