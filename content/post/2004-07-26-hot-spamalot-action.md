You may have heard about the new Monty Python-inspired musical _Spamalot_, which is previewing in Chicago before going to Broadway.

A group of us have purchased a block of seats for the January 11, 2005 show. They are center row, pretty close up (not orchestra, but the next section back).

We have a bunch still available, but they&#8217;ll go fast. If you want one or more of the seats, email me at [matt [at] windyhop [dot] org][1] ASAP. They are $67 each, and you can pay via PayPal or check. Or cash, of course.
