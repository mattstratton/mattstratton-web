Scout, Carrie, and I are chilling up in northern Michigan at my in-laws&#8217; lake house. We return to proper society tomorrow night.

Yesterday we went to &#8220;downtown&#8221; Traverse City and I took a bunch of pictures of interesting objects. We also drove in my father-in-law&#8217;s convertible. And then we went to see the Lovin&#8217; Spoonful play a concert. Seriously.

Today we are going to go out on the boat and Carrie is going to attempt to water ski (it&#8217;s very windy today). Then tonight we&#8217;re going to go to a Travese City Beach Bum baseball game.
