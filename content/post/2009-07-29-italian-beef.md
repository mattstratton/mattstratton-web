If you are local to Chicago, pick up a copy of today&#8217;s <a href="https://redeye.chicagotribune.com/" target="_blank">RedEye</a>, and turn to page 4. There you will see an article debating the relative merits of &#8220;dipped&#8221; vs. &#8220;undipped&#8221; for the Chicago delicacy known as the Italian beef sandwich.

For the uninformed, a &#8220;dipped&#8221; beef sandwich is one in which, after the beef has been perfectly placed upon the torpedo roll, the entire sandwich is then submerged, ever so briefly, in the _au jus_ from which the beef came. This results in a permeation of the beef juice throughout the bread, which is, in a word, delicious.

And why should one only consume Italian beef sandwiches that have been properly dipped? Here is my pro-dipping argument, as printed in the July 29, 2009 edition of the Red Eye:

> The first reason to get your beef dipped: to remove any question of the freshness of the bread. You can never be sure how fresh those torpedo rolls might be – but even if the roll is slightly stale, a quick juice bath will freshen it right up. I also believe that the deliciousness should extend throughout the entire sandwich experience – every single bite should burst with explosive beefy wonder. Without dipping, you run the risk of a few dry bites. This is unacceptable

The RedEye did leave off my concluding statement, which was as follows:

> Perhaps the most important reason for dipped beef? Someone’s gotta keep those paper napkin factories in business.

I&#8217;m sure that the RedEye will no doubt claim that this was clipped due to &#8216;space constraints&#8217; or some other journalistic jargon, but in reality, I believe this exposes the stranglehold that the paper napkin cartels have over the media in this country. If this doesn&#8217;t frighten you, you&#8217;re just as naive as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000793/" target="_blank">Kay Adams</a>.

My position on beef dippage has generally garnered support and agreement from family friends:

_&#8220;There are maybe 5 men in the world I&#8217;d consider credible on this topic and you are one of them.&#8221;_ &#8211; TheCook (real name withheld)

_&#8220;I am proud, and I support your position 100%.&#8221; &#8211; Jeff R._

_&#8220;Everyone gets one shot a fame. Unfortunately yours was wasted on a quote in the RedEye about a sandwich. PS. I like my beef dipped too.&#8221;_ &#8211; Dan Schultz

_&#8220;I feel slightly hungry for meat way too early in the morning.&#8221;_ &#8211; My sister Debbie

That being said, I was surprised to discover that a man whose opinion on the topic of Italian beef I have always respected, took an opposite tack:

_&#8220;If Italian Beef was meant to be dipped, it would come presoaked swimming in a bowl of juice where the whole sandwich could be eaten with a spoon. Besides, a GOOD Italian beef sandwich would never come on a stale roll. Especially not at <a href="https://www.portillos.com/" target="_blank">Portillo&#8217;s</a>, home of the best Italian beef (and the best food in general) on the planet.&#8221;_ &#8211; My father-in-law

This statement shocked me to the very core. However, it did explain why my wife had no idea that Italian beef sandwiches could, nay, _should_ be dipped. I am happy to report that she does side with me on this subject, however.

Clearly there is no more important subject by which to identify yourself as a Chicagoan that this. Sure, we can align via baseball team allegiance or even city vs. suburbs&#8230;but these demarcations pale in comparison to this most crucial of all personal definitions.

Where do YOU stand?
