I&#8217;ve been getting some nice comments from people involved in the production of _Dancing With Gaia_.

&#8220;I enjoyed every last minute I spent working on DWG. I was actually amazed at how much fun I had! Everyone was so much fun to work with, and you guys kept things organized without being task masters. I think that I was darn lucky to start my film career with such a great project. I am kind of scared that whatever I work on next will be a disappointment, because I don&#8217;t see how I could top the experience I had working with you guys.&#8221;

&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what to expect when I started this project and I am so impressed and pleased with the structure, encouragement and camaraderie that was developed under your direction.&#8221;

&#8220;Despite sacrificed weekends and evenings&#8230;there was never a second that I wasn&#8217;t absolutely confident of my desire to be in your project or of its success. I honestly have a feeling it could be the beginning of a successful company.&#8221;

&#8220;I had such a wonderful time during the shoot. I really got to know and love a lot of the cast and crew, and it&#8217;s sad that, like every other production, it had to eventually come to an end. I would be thrilled and honored to be a part of any future project associated with Gravy Train Films. Thanks so much for taking a chance on me.&#8221;
