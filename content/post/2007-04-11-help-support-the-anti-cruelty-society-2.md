Again this year, Carrie, Scout, and I will be participating in [Bark in the Park][1] &#8211; a 5K run/walk to support the [Anti-Cruelty Society][2].

If you feel like donating money to this cause (which is a worthy one), you can do so via our [fundraising page][3].

Even if you don&#8217;t want to donate, I encourage anyone in the Chicago area who either has a dog, or likes dogs, to come join us on May 5 for the event. It&#8217;s a LOT of fun.
