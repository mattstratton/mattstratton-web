Basically, it tells me that I have won some free bowling, and all I have to do is print out the attached certificates, make a reservation, and voila. I am off to bowling heaven.

Well, there are two problems with the email. First of all, the attachments are files that end with .sig and .shs. Um, I&#8217;m not going to just randomly open these files I&#8217;ve never heard of, even on my Mac (as it happens, that file type is a Print Shop file. I&#8217;m not surprised.)

Secondly, this email was sent to about 100 people. All of whom were listed in the &#8220;To&#8221; field. So that means that all Diversey Rock and Bowl customers whose first name starts with L to M now have my email address. Brilliant.

I sent &#8220;Gary&#8221; an email explaining to him why he was a friggin&#8217; moron (but in nicer terms). The ultimate irony? It was returned to me to go through SpamArrest verification.

Yes, that&#8217;s right. Mr. Spammy Spammerson of Diversey Rock and Bowl demands that anyone emailing HIM go through a CAPTCHA process.

If it weren&#8217;t for the fact that we know a hot bartender there, I&#8217;d never go back. Unless they send me a certificate for free bowling in a file format that I like :)
