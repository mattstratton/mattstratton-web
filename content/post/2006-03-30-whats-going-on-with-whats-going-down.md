I haven&#8217;t posted much in the way of updates lately, so here&#8217;s some stuff.

**Work**
  
It&#8217;s work-tastic. Fat Johnny is leaving our team in a few weeks, which sucks. Although at least he still works at the Bank, so I can continue to ask him dumb questions.

**Apartment**
  
Last night Carrie and I got the last few things from our respective old places. It feels good to have everything moved in. We&#8217;re about 75% done unpacking, although the next step is going to be going through everything and making a lot of donations to the Salvation Army. Also, I need a drill.

**Wedding**
  
A date has been set (May 26, 2007), and a location booked for the ceremony (Old St. Pat&#8217;s downtown). We&#8217;re working on the reception venue right now. We looked at the Swissotel last week, but decided it was much too small. Plus, it was on the 40th floor (which had great views), but our smoker friends would have to go down 40 floors to smoke. Which meant that we would never see Chris at the entire wedding. So that was nixed. On Tuesday we looked at the City Center Hotel on Ohio at Fairbanks, and so far, that&#8217;s the frontrunner. Saturday we&#8217;re going to look at the James Hotel, but hopefully we&#8217;ll have something booked in the next week or so. Carrie has a problem with The Knot. Like, an addiction problem. I have a problem with The Knot as well. Like, it&#8217;s a terrible website that makes me want to throw things while ranting about usability and design.

**Friends**
  
Do I still have those things? I haven&#8217;t seen much of anyone except Brian and Tracy lately. I blame moving. I should call some people.
