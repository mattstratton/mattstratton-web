Saw Soul Asylum last night at the Goose Island street fair.

Wow, do those boys know how to rock. I haven&#8217;t seen them live since 94 (I think) when they toured with Spin Doctors and Screaming Trees.

The only song Backstreet knew was &#8220;Runaway Train&#8221;. But Tracy and I were digging on all the stuff. And they played &#8220;Summer of Drugs&#8221;. My roommate&#8217;s boyfriend clued me in last night to their greatest hits CD, &#8220;Black Gold&#8221;. I also re-aquired a copy of &#8220;And The Horse They Rode In On&#8221; which used to be my favorite SA album.
