Man, there is a lot of orchestrating going on&#8230;

I have most everything taken care of. I still am trying to find a place to stick Chris and Heather T-B for Saturday night. I&#8217;m really embarrassed that I forgot to follow through on that &#8211; I had intended to talk to Larry about it, and I thought I did, but apparently I didn&#8217;t. And in my absence, Tom snagged their couch space :)

So if any of you New York types can put up Chris and/or Heather for Saturday night, it will help me a LOT.

Crazy!
