[<img class="alignright" style="margin: 3px;" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2482/3876987406_38a06934e2.jpg" alt="Doniree" width="200" height="300" />][1]My blogging buddy <a href="https://doniree.com" target="_blank">Doniree</a> is trying like mad to hook up her dream writing gig &#8211; and she needsÂ  YOUR help.

Step one is for her to gather as many votes as possible, to prove her command of the wonders of viral marketing. **Voting ends on November 7, 2009**, so there&#8217;s only a few more days left, but we need to get her up to at least 2,000 votes. And I&#8217;m hoping you, my loyal readers, can help out.

If Doni&#8217;s undying gratitude is not enough incentive, **she&#8217;s also offering up a bit of a contest**. Every time you vote for her, blog about voting for her, or tweet about voting for her, you can be entered into a drawing for a free Nintendo DSi <a href="https://doniree.com/2009/10/18/the-good-mood-blogger-gig-and-a-free-nintendo-dsi/" target="_blank">just by posting a comment on her blog</a>. That&#8217;s pretty awesome. Of course, if you&#8217;re not interested in winning prizes, that shouldn&#8217;t keep you from voting anyway. As an added incentive &#8211; if every time you vote for Doni, you post a comment on THIS blog post, **I&#8217;ll enter it into a drawing of my own for a special prize** (no, I&#8217;m not going to tell you what it is&#8230;but trust me, it will be cool!)

Please <a href="https://www.sam-e.com/job/profile/195" target="_blank">vote for Doni</a> once a day, **every day**, until Nov 7. I know if I can marshal up the Good Old Rock army, we can put her over the top and make her blogging dream come true.
