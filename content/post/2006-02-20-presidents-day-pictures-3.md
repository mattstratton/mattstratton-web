Tracy and I both had today off, so this afternoon we walked down to Lake Michigan to take some pictures (since it was such a lovely clear day).

It was friggin&#8217; cold, but the sky was so clear and the sun was so bright that I got [some great pictures][1] &#8211; including some of Tracy climbing a tree, as well as a bunch of neat stuff by the lake.

Enjoy!

[Full Set][1]
