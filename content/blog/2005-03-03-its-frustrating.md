&#8230;when you want to be upset with someone, but you really cannot.

I do know that it seems like every day, things happen that make it seem easier to think about leaving this town. Friends are moving away (either literally in some cases, or figuratively in others).

In so many ways, the Black and Tan and Windyhop are really good examples of where I am. There was a time when the B&T was \*the\* event to not miss, and Windyhop was a thriving and important part of the swing scene here.

But now both feel like they have run their course. People don&#8217;t seem to really care if they stay or if they go. And sometimes I get that feeling socially here too.
