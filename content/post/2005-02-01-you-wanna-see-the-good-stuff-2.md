Good idea inspired by .

For the lurkers:

1) <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/create.bml" target="blank">create an LJ account.</a>

2) email me with your username.

3) Now, I add you to my friends list, and you have authorization to read any entries I&#8217;ve marked as private. However, you must <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/login.bml" target="blank">Log In</a> each time you visit my journal to see the locked entries. The good stuff is almost always &#8220;Friends Only&#8221;.
