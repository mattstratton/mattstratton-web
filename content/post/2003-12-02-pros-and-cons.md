So on the advice (albeit somewhat sarcastic) of Erika, I am creating a pro/con list for Carrie. We&#8217;ll see how this works out:

_Pro_
  
**Good cook** &#8211; she is a great cook/baker and really likes making things. And I like eating things. Plus I like cooking too.
  
**Likes kids** &#8211; she&#8217;s a freak on wheels about children (go figure, she&#8217;s a teacher).
  
**No Cats** &#8211; not only is she cat-free, but she too is allergic to them. I don&#8217;t think you realize how difficult it is to find a single woman in this town who doesn&#8217;t own a cat.
  
**Jewish grandmother** &#8211; her grandma is Jewish, so she knows a bit about the traditions, but more importantly, she likes the food. We&#8217;ve been on two dates to The Bagel already.
  
**Ginormous hooters** &#8211; hey, it&#8217;s a pro. At least I&#8217;m honest.
  
**Super helpful and sweet** &#8211; she is always offering to help me with stuff, be it birthday plans or doing stuff around the house. Granted, we haven&#8217;t done those things, but the offering goes a long way in my eyes.

&#8212;
  
_Cons_
  
**Taste** &#8211; she likes so very little that I like in the way of movies. And also some TV shows and music, but that&#8217;s less important. Movies are a big part of who I am. I don&#8217;t know if I can be with someone who is looking forward to seeing _Cheaper by the Dozen_
  
**Ticklish** &#8211; wow, what a stupid reason to list as a &#8220;con&#8221;, but trust me, it can be a problem. &#8216;Nuff said.
  
**Catholic** &#8211; she&#8217;s pretty religious. Well, religious enough to go to church every Sunday and she sings in the choir. But she knows I am Jewish, and has never even blinked at me keeping kosher or any of that stuff. So maybe it&#8217;s not that much of a &#8220;con&#8221; after all (incidentally, I just watched _Keeping the Faith_ last night).
  
**Family** &#8211; she comes from a very close family (she&#8217;s at her parents&#8217; house at least once a week to visit and see her sisters and all that). I come from a very independent background, and that kind of family closeness sometimes creeps me out.
  
**Language** &#8211; she uses words like &#8220;snotty&#8221; and refers to people as &#8220;brats&#8221;. I chalk this up to her working with 2nd graders all day, but for some reason that is like nails on the chalkboard to me.

I can&#8217;t think of any more; maybe I will add to this later.
