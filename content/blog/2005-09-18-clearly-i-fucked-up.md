I sent Jaymie an email on Friday, per everyone&#8217;s advice:

_Hope you got home okay last night. Just wanted to drop a note to say that I had a really good time last night. And not just because you used to have L+R on vinyl._

_I hope we can get together again after I get back from my Wisconsin backwoods adventure._

_m._

As of 2 PM Sunday, no reply.

I think that calling her is inappropriate at this point. I am guessing that she is having second thoughts about how things went. Good job.
