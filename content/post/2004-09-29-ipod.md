So with my new Mini, I only have 4 GB of space on my iPod.

My music library is many many times the size of that. No problem. I have the iPod set to sync a random selection of size 4 GB.

So I&#8217;m sitting here listening to my iPod and work, and wondering how my iPod managed to find the 4 GB of music in my libary that is absolute CRAP.
