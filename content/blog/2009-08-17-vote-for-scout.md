[<img class="alignright" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/45/143152888_ec035f12a1.jpg" alt="Scout" width="300" height="225" />][1]My dog, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mugsy/tags/scout" target="_blank">Scout</a>, has been <a href="/tags/scout/" target="_self">featured on this blog</a> in the past. He&#8217;s a 4 year old Shetland Sheepdog, and I think he&#8217;s all kinds of adorable. He&#8217;s also neurotic, but that&#8217;s beside the point.

Scout has been entered into the <a href="https://www.cutestdogcompetition.com/vote.cfm?h=80A88C2A1240FA14E4ECCB2178805562" target="_blank">Cutest Dog Contest</a>, which has actual Cash Prizes. If you agree that Scout is very cute (or just want to be supportive), please vote for him. You can <a href="https://bit.ly/7lLK5" target="_blank">vote once a day</a>, and there&#8217;s no registration required.
