OK, I am getting really excited/nervous for this party tonight.

My stomach is going nuts. Part of it is work stress, but most of it is an-ti-ci-pation.

I was talking to Partytom about this last night &#8211; I rarely get surprised by things. I guess I live my life in such a way that I usually know what is going on. Plus, most people aren&#8217;t good at keeping secrets.

I think the other thing is that usually I am on the other side of this &#8211; I am the one doing the planning, etc. Which makes me feel weird to not be. But it is good.

Chris is picking me up at work at 3:30 and then the birthday madness begins! I am in a really good mood now.
