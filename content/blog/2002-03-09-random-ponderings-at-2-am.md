So I&#8217;m reading&#8230;and my journal has got to be one of the most boring things in the world&#8230;if you read the entries so far, they&#8217;re mostly &#8220;meta&#8221; information&#8230;journaling about journaling.

Not very exciting.

I noticed that Kate had added me as a &#8220;friend&#8221; of hers on livejournal&#8230;that&#8217;s kind of cool&#8230;and weird&#8230;I mean, I&#8217;ve met Kate about twice. And only really ever talked to her once&#8230;when I was in Rochester back in October. But she is cool as hell, so it was pretty interesting to read her journal. Hers is a hell of a lot more interesting than mine, at least. Mine has no robots in it.

I met up with some of my old Players Workshop buddies tonight. It was supposed to be the whole group, but only Larry, Amy, Jon, Jay, and myself were there. Which wasn&#8217;t anything special; I see those guys all the time. We met up at Jack&#8217;s (the bar by the Atheneum where we used to go after class) and then after a couple drinks, Jay went home and Larry, Amy, Jon, and I went to Marigold for karoke. Larry and I were going to sing &#8220;Dead or Alive&#8221; by Bon Jovi, but the DJ had already heard it. So I didn&#8217;t sing tonight.

Larry&#8217;s hard to read. He was asking me a lot of questions about the film, but I don&#8217;t know if he was just making fun of me. Jon was complaining to me that he hasn&#8217;t had sex in a long time, but I guarantee it was much more recently than me. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about that whole thing; it seems like it&#8217;s been forever, but then I talk to some of my friends (always female ones) and they&#8217;ve gone for MUCH longer. So either women can have a longer dry spell than men, or my female friends don&#8217;t want to admit they&#8217;ve had sex outside of a relationship for fear of looking like a slut. I&#8217;m just guessing, and that last guess was pretty much a joke.

I got a raise today. Proof positive that you can fall asleep in your boss&#8217;s office and still get a 4% pay raise. It&#8217;s not much, but considering that I wasn&#8217;t expecting ANYTHING, it&#8217;s totally gravy. It was good to hear my boss notices the things that I do&#8230;specifically the things that I think really help contribute to our success. I \*do\* have to work on punctuality and attendance. I&#8217;m glad he didn&#8217;t beat me up too much about that, or imply that it was due to my &#8220;extra-curriculars&#8221;.

Jon and I talked a lot about THE TAO OF STEVE tonight. After consideration, I think the problem I have is I always forget about step 3&#8230;&#8221;be gone.&#8221; I always stick around. But I don&#8217;t like the idea of having to play a &#8220;game&#8221;. I always say (and I try to believe) that &#8220;you can&#8217;t trick someone into liking you.&#8221; If someone really likes me, they&#8217;re going to like me. I can&#8217;t fool them. And even if I could, I wouldn&#8217;t want to&#8230;I want someone to like me for me&#8230;whoever &#8220;me&#8221; happens to be that day.

Of course, some days I just want to make out with someone. I call those days &#8220;weekdays&#8221;.
