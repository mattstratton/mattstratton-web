It&#8217;s damn late, and I&#8217;ve got so much crap to do tomorrow&#8230;yet, I&#8217;m online, messing around. This is not a good trend for me. I blame the wireless network card.

Went bowling tonight with the cast. I think everyone had a good time. I bowled halfway decently &#8211; averaged about 130 over four games. Too bad DT couldn&#8217;t be there; I think it was a good night for the ensemble. I still feel detatched from them, but maybe that&#8217;s a good thing&#8230;I&#8217;m the director&#8230;I&#8217;m the boss&#8230;there needs to be that level of respect, etc&#8230;and they all need to trust each OTHER. So I guess it&#8217;s okay.

I&#8217;m hungry. I have no food in the house though. It&#8217;s probably just as well.

Got the camera today&#8230;[Canon GL1][1]. It&#8217;s the shitty bomb. It&#8217;s not as badass as the [XL1S][2], but that&#8217;s a bit out of budget. Tried to film my roommate&#8217;s cat, but he was non-cooperative. Hmph.

OK&#8230;the sleepies just hit me hardcore. Time to sign off, yo.
