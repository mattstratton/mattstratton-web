I was talking to a friend today about being single (what else do I talk to people about, right?)

And I realized&#8230;right now, I&#8217;m Steve Dunne from _Singles_. I&#8217;m just concentrating on work. Work keeps me sane. Seriously.

I mean, it worked for him. He ended up with Kyra Sedgwick.

Of course, I don&#8217;t have a job&#8230;

But seriously, folks. It&#8217;s nice to be busy. I&#8217;ve got so much crap going on right now that it&#8217;s a damn good thing I don&#8217;t have to deal with woman issues. And I look at some people (who will remain nameless) who are having issues with their significant others, and I hear all the drama, and the blah blah blah, and I say &#8220;Hmm&#8230;is getting laid worth all that?&#8221; It&#8217;s not. At least not right now.

The most recent male/female interaction I&#8217;ve had was a couple weeks ago &#8211; I met this girl at Clybar when I was out with Rak and C. She was cute, and funny, and into a lot of the same pop culture stuff as me. Things seemed okay that night. We went out the next night, and all she did was talk about how amazed she was that I could possibly be interested in her. A tad on the insane side of whackadoo, as well. It got really old really fast.

I know that there was a time I wouldn&#8217;t have walked away from that &#8211; I would have been happy to have anyone. But now I just say, fuck it, Dude&#8230;let&#8217;s go bowling.
