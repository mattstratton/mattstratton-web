As asked by :

_1. How did you first get involved in filmmaking?_

I studied theatre at <a href="http://www.millikin.edu" title="Millikin University" target="_blank">Millikin University</a>, but did nothing with it. Until a few years ago, when Dallas and I decided it would be &#8220;fun&#8221; to make a mock-doc about the swing dancing scene. That was what start <a href="http://www.dancingwithgaia.com" title="Dancing With Gaia" target="_blank"><em>Dancing With Gaia</em></a>. I think that my love of film really came from the Cinema class I took in high school though, taught by <a href="http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/reviews_pages/r22.htm#Amelio" title="Ralph Amelio" target="_blank">Ralph J. Amelio</a>.

_2. How did you first get involved in LiveJournal?_

I don&#8217;t recall how I came across it at first&#8230;I posted a couple things when I created my account, mostly about breaking up with my girlfriend at the time. Then I saw that had a link to her LJ in her AIM profile, and I said &#8220;hey, I&#8217;ve got one of those&#8221;, and started journaling again.

_3. What is your favorite thing to do in your spare time?_

I&#8217;m embarassed to say that it&#8217;s watching TV. Especially stuff on **Adult Swim** on Cartoon Network.

_4. What was the most daring thing you&#8217;ve ever done?_

I think it was when I went rock climbing in New Mexico when I was 16.

_5. What is the airspeed velocity of an unlaiden swallow?_

According to my <a href="http://www.style.org/unladenswallow/" title="one swallow doesn't make a spring" target="_blank">research</a>, it is roughly 11 meters per second, or 24 miles an hour.
