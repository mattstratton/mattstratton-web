[Bruce][1] is gone.

What a pain. She was supposed to fly out last night. i came home from work, and she was still there. Apparently her flight was &#8220;delayed&#8221; because there &#8220;weren&#8217;t enough people on it&#8221;, so she was going to fly out this morning now, so could she please stay one more night?

Alledgely her new flight was at 9 am this morning. I told her she&#8217;d probably need to leave at around 5:30 am due to traffic, etc. When I went to bed, she was heading out to meet a friend, apparently.

I woke up this morning at 6 am, and she was not here, but her stuff still was. I left my Powerbook (the only real thing of value that I own) at my neighbors and went to work.

I pretty much assumed I would come home tonight to find her still here, and have to kick her out. Luckily, she was gone, and my keys were in the mailbox.

I doubt she went back to Australia. I don&#8217;t think she had a ticket home at all. I&#8217;m pretty sure she probably got kicked out of her place last month and just needed someplace to crash, and probably realized that I was about to kick her out and the bullshit stories wouldn&#8217;t fly anymore.

Oh, and she ate my leftovers last night that I was going to have for dinner.

But she&#8217;s gone now. Thank goodness. I&#8217;m happy to have my house back.
