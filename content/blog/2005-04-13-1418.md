The other night, I was talking to about a certain someone in the national swing scene. We&#8217;ll call him &#8220;Allen&#8221;.

I was saying you know, considering we all hate this kid so much&#8230;why do we talk about him ALL THE TIME?

Seriously.

Every&nbsp; time I am together with a bunch of swingies, at some point or another, the topic of &#8220;Allen&#8221; comes up. And we spend about 20 minutes discussing this guy.

Why do we spend so much of our precious time and energy on people we don&#8217;t like? For example, if someone brought up , the conversation would go like this:

Person A: So yeah, Roberta&#8230;
  
Person B: Roberta is awesome! She&#8217;s so sweet. Plus she is pretty.
  
Person A: She rocks! But you know who DOESN&#8217;T rock&#8230;

Get it?

I decided that &#8220;Allen&#8221; is the Paris Hilton of the swing scene. Everyone in the national scene knows who he is. People talk about him all the time. Nobody actually likes him, but he&#8217;s a major topic of conversation.

Just like Paris.

I guess that makes Yehoodi like _US Weekly_.
