So I just talked to Kevin at Mosaic.

Apparently they had to reschedule that interview AGAIN&#8230;so they are meeting TOMORROW morning to make their &#8220;next step&#8221; decision. So I should hear back tomorrow afternoon.

The worst thing is&#8230;said &#8220;decision&#8221; may just be &#8220;okay, now we want you guys to come in for a second round interview.&#8221;

I feel like crying. I can&#8217;t take this. I went through this dragged-out process with Citadel, and that poofed in my face.
