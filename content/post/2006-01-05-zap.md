I&#8217;m finally doing it.

On Tuesday, I will be going in for my LASIK consult (although I got &#8220;consulted&#8221; for LASIK back in 2001, and was &#8220;approved&#8221;, and my eyes haven&#8217;t changed much, so I&#8217;m fairly certain it&#8217;s gonna be a go).

If they decide they can zap my eyes, I&#8217;ll be most likely having the surgery the following week.

Thanks to a great discount with my insurance, I am getting this done for only $895/eye.

I can&#8217;t wait.

But I am really kind of scared.
