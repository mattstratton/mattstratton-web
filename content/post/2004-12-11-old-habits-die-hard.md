So the good news is, I was able to standby on my flight yesterday, so I got into NYC at around 4 ish instead of midnight. Yay!

Larry picked me up at the airport because he rules. I am an idiot and forgot to bring both keys to Amanda&#8217;s place, so I had no way to get in&#8230;so Larry and I hung out at his house and played with the dog, and watched cartoons. Good times.

Headed back to Amanda&#8217;s later, and we had some good Thai food, and then met up with Fredo (and eventually Zoe) at a bar in Brooklyn. Everyone else I was hoping to see this weekend was in Manhattan for a movie. When I finally did get a hold of Larry later, it was midnight, and some people were apparently leaving, but I couldn&#8217;t quite understand everything he was saying. Plus I had just gotten off the phone w/ Beck who was in a cab on her way to Floyd, so it wasn&#8217;t like changing venues was really an option.

It was kind of a hard evening for me &#8211; I do NOT do well in social situations where I don&#8217;t know people. I find myself sitting back and becoming an observer &#8211; especially when there are a lot of alpha-males who clearly are used to being the funniest/wittiest one there. Overall, it turned out to be a fine evening (Amanda and I had a discussion at dinner about how different people interact, so the evening became a sociology project for me), but I was a little bummed that I spent the night talking about IMB to a close-talking guy instead of some other people. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get a chance to see them later this weekend. If not, I&#8217;ll be back again. If nothing else, this was another good learning experience for my moving decision &#8211; I don&#8217;t want everything to be sunshine and roses, because that is unrealistic, and reminding myself that even in a new city, I&#8217;m still terribly shy was a good thing.
