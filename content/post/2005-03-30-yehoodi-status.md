FYI, I just talked to Frankyboy, and here&#8217;s the story:

Mugsy Malone 74: I assum you guys know you&#8217;ve been down for a day?
  
Frankyboy: yes we do bro
  
Mugsy Malone 74: I figured. I just keep getting im-ed from people who, for some reason, assume i know what is going on
  
Frankyboy: an incompetent hacker
  
Mugsy Malone 74: eep!
  
Frankyboy: his hack just ruined everything, didn&#8217;t steal root
  
Mugsy Malone 74: is there an official something I can post on WH or at least for the people who keep asking?
  
Mugsy Malone 74: so that people stop bugging YOU? :)
  
Frankyboy: yes, tell them that
  
Mugsy Malone 74: eta?
  
Frankyboy: someone tried to hack us and only ruined our server, we&#8217;re resetting up everything
  
Frankyboy: no eta as of yet

**Edit: According to Eff, they will be back online &#8220;within a few days&#8221;.**
