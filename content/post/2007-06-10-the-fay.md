asked for a picture of our new car, so I took one today when we brought Scout to the dog park in Deerfield.

The dog park was super awesome &#8211; about 20 acres of off-leash dog area. Cost us $10 for a one-day pass (since we are not residents of Lake County) but well worth it. Scout is completely tuckered out, and we had a great time.
