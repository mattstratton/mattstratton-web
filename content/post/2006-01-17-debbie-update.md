My little sister is currently spending the semester in Verona, Italy. She got there last week, and here&#8217;s the latest email from her:

_Hey everyone!!! First I want to apologize for not being able
  
to write all of you back, or at least not extensively! But I
  
do really appreciate all of the replies and emails I have
  
been receiving. They all make me smile, and remind me of why
  
I miss all of you so much (awwww)!! Oh, and thanks for all
  
of the scccccandalous emials I&#8217;ve been receiving from
  
\*cough\* a few of you&#8230;.dot dot dot_

_I know it&#8217;s obnoxiously expensive/impossible to call me, and
  
most of you aren&#8217;t up at 7:30 or 8AM when I am online&#8230;But,
  
my cell phone number is \***\***\***\***\*** and i beleive the country
  
code is 39 so you dial something like 039\***\***\*****. I won&#8217;t
  
be hurt if you can&#8217;t, I understand._

_The Olympic torch passed throw Verona last night&#8230;? Pretty
  
exciting stuff._

_Anyways, all in all the whole Verona group is awesome. One
  
of the girls is going home tomorrow. I am really suprised
  
because she went to Sicily over the summer (with Joyce :)),
  
but it really is a HUGE change._

_I definitely took a cribs tour in pictures of my apartment,
  
but this effing computer can&#8217;t handle anything. I&#8217;ll let you
  
all know when I finally figure it out. Thanks for all the
  
love._

_I love all of you!!!_
