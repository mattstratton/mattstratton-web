so, based upon something she said in [this entry][1], I just spent the last hour copy-pasting all of <span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://swingdoc.livejournal.com/"><strong>swingdoc</strong></a></span>&#8216;s LJ entries into a word file.

Based upon what <span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://tjmweb.livejournal.com/"><strong>tjmweb</strong></a></span> and his [Filmtease][2]{.snap_shots} cronies were able to do with [lulu.com][3]{.snap_shots}, I was thinking it would be a neat present for Kim to put her journal into &#8220;book&#8221; form &#8211; order one copy of it for her, and then take it offline.

So if anyone has neat ideas for cover art, etc, or just general ideas about it, that would be cool. The next step is to take the 284 page Word file I now have, clean it up, and put it in the right order (for some stupid reason I put the entries in the exact opposite order then should be in the book).

It should go without saying that nobody should tell Kim about this.
