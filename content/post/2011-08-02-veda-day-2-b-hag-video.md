In today&#8217;s <a href="http://weblogwevlog.com/" target="_blank">VEDA </a> video, I discuss my B-HAG (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal). It actually isn&#8217;t that big OR audacious, and it&#8217;s also fairly geeky. Consider yourself warned.



I also discovered a couple of interesting things while doing this video today:

1) iMovie doesn&#8217;t let you &#8220;save&#8221; your password in the YouTube export settings. Which is pretty much incompatible with [Google&#8217;s Two-Step Authentication][1]. That sucks. I am going to have to think of a different mechanism. I think that the process now will have to be to export the movie to MP4 or MOV from iMovie, and then manually upload to YouTube. Which means I have to figure out the best export settings for YouTube.

2) Making and publishing these videos takes a lot longer than I would like. I think I started this around 6 AM, and it wasn&#8217;t up on YouTube until about 7 AM. So either I have to do them in the evenings, which I am not a fan of, or I have to make the process faster.
