I need a job.

Like, now.

The market is so freakin&#8217; bleak right now. Nobody seems to understand this.

I am in a situation lately where everyone ignores my requests. I email people asking them for help &#8211; just saying &#8220;hey, is there anything open by you?&#8221;&#8230;and they don&#8217;t even bother replying.

If anyone in the Chicago area knows of ANY job openings I can qualify for that can help me out, that would be much appreciated. I am starting to think that there&#8217;s nothing in IT anymore, so at this point, I&#8217;ll take anything. Actually, I would take a help desk position at this point, if it was in the city, just to get &#8220;in&#8221; at a company.

Thanks for listening, erm, reading.
