So I&#8217;m working on the press kit for _Dancing With Gaia_, and sent out some interview stuff for the actors/crew so that I could have some material.

I got so much funny stuff back that I can&#8217;t use&#8230;but some of it just kills me. So I&#8217;m sharing it with you here:

_All of my film experiences have been positive, but I also screen projects well before I commit to anything. Projects I&#8217;ve turned down include one for a guy who wanted me to play a modern-day Little Red Riding Hood who gets stripped naked, tied to her grandmother&#8217;s kitchen table and eaten alive by the Wolf and another film where a &#8216;director&#8217; wanted to know how many black leather fetish outfits I owned to use as costumes for his sci-fi, sex-fantasy flick involving space hookers. I told them both, as the great Merryl Streep once said, &#8220;No, thanks. I sell my acting, not my ass.&#8221; To which they replied, &#8220;Oh no, you must&#8217;ve misunderstood; we weren&#8217;t planning on paying you._
  
&#8212; Jen Wilding, &#8220;Christine&#8221;

_&#8220;Dancing with Gaia&#8221; is about the swing dance troupe that shouldn&#8217;t._
  
&#8212; Kitty Mortland, &#8220;Emily&#8221;

_I&#8217;m just waiting for Matt and Dallas to contact me with the script for &#8220;Flying and Failing: The Mike Wellington Story&#8221;._
  
&#8212; Fuzzy Gerdes, &#8220;Mike Wellington&#8221;

_I thrive on working with people who are creative, talented artists in addition to being organized, professional, business-minded individuals who are just good people. Matt & Dallas are very much all of these things and they work very well together. In fact, I heard that Dallas was thinking of changing his name to &#8216;Ben&#8217; just so they could submit stuff as &#8220;Matt and Ben&#8221; and perhaps get some publicity thru tabloids raising questions about what kind of relationship they really have behind the scenes._

(I had to put in both by Wilding because she&#8217;s freakin&#8217; hilarious)
