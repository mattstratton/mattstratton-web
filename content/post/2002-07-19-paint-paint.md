So I&#8217;m &#8220;living the madcap unemployed bachelor life,&#8221; as Dallas puts it, and painting my living room.

Well, not right **now**, but during the day.

Yesterday I prepped the walls and primed (we had a lot of peeling and water damage). I had to use an oil-based primer (due to the water stains) and it made for messy messy cleanup. I hope the paint thinner didn&#8217;t make me sick.

Today I will paint the main color for the walls; it&#8217;s a kind of eggshell. Then, tomorrow, it is trim time &#8211; it&#8217;s going to be a greenish color. Basically, the two colors were picked out of a painting that goes in that room.

I hope it turns out well.
