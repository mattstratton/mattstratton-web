I&#8217;ts almost five am. I woke up, and now I can&#8217;t go back to sleep. Yargh.

NYC trip off to a good start. Had a lot of fun at the baseball games this weekend, despite the losses by the Cubs. Went to the [Pussycat Lounge][1]{.snap_shots} on Saturday night with <span class="ljuser" style="white-space:nowrap;"><a href="http://jodiemim.livejournal.com/"><strong>jodiemim</strong></a></span> and Miss Behave &#8211; that was a good time. Sunday I went to see <span style="font-style:italic;">Mr. and Mrs. Smith</span> with <span class="ljuser" style="white-space:nowrap;"><a href="http://larrykang.livejournal.com/"><strong>larrykang</strong></a></span> after having dinner with him and <span class="ljuser" style="white-space:nowrap;"><a href="http://robertajean.livejournal.com/"><strong>robertajean</strong></a></span> at a neat little Japanese joint in Queens.

Last night was <span style="font-style:italic;">Batman Begins</span> with <span class="ljuser" style="white-space:nowrap;"><a href="http://swingfeline.livejournal.com/"><strong>swingfeline</strong></a></span>, followed by sushi with her, Josh, and Devona at Iron Chef. That was a really good movie. And Amanda, yes, it appears that it \*was\* Gary Oldman as Gordon. I&#8217;m always impressed with how Oldman can lose himself into a role. Pretty sweet.

I worked out of our downtown office yesterday. It was cool to meet some people in person, but I&#8217;m not quite sure why I decided to work there instead of just remotely all week. We&#8217;ll see what happens. I may just decide to work out of Amanda&#8217;s house the rest of the week.

Tonight is improv with <span class="ljuser" style="white-space:nowrap;"><a href="http://nandoasti.livejournal.com/"><strong>nandoasti</strong></a></span>. Tomorrow no &#8220;official&#8221; plans, although Josh told me there is rumor of a BKS trip (you paying attention here, <span class="ljuser" style="white-space:nowrap;"><a href="http://darlyn.livejournal.com/"><strong>darlyn</strong></a></span> ?) Thursday will be Frim Fram, and Friday there&#8217;s some pre-Mermaid party action. Saturday is, of course, the Mermaid Parade, and then I wing back to Chicago on Sunday evening.
