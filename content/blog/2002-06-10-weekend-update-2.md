Friday night I went to see [Dancing To Nite][1]&#8230;[GTF][2] is producing a promo video of the show, so I was doing some &#8220;scouting&#8221;. I think we&#8217;ll be shooting it this Friday and another Wednesday.

After the show went to Inn Joy with some friends&#8230;dragged C\___ along with. It was amusing &#8211; she&#8217;s not a big drinker, and she was hanging with me and Noah. We tried to explain to her that there wasn&#8217;t a problem in the world that can&#8217;t be solved with liquor, but I&#8217;m not sure she was convinced. She had a glass of wine though. Party!

Saturday evening, we had a surprise dinner thing for my roommate&#8217;s boyfriend. It was pretty good&#8230;I got good and drunk (strong drinks). Afterwards, Jayno and I went over to Brian&#8217;s place to see the Lennox/Tyson fight. To quote of of my friends, &#8220;I don&#8217;t normally like to watch boxing, but I love seeing a rapist bleed.&#8221; Then we played poker until 4 AM. I broke even.

Sunday all I did was sleep, watch TV, and read the second _Harry Potter_ book. I headed out to Oak Park with Jayno and Chris to see Bopology (the suckiest swing band in the world). Then Jayno and I had dinner at the Northside, and I went home and went to bed.

Exciting stuff, neh?
