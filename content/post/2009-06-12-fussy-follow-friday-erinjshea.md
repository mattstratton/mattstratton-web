_For those of you not familiar&#8230;Fussy Follow Friday is based upon the concept that instead of a glut of Twitter follow recommendations, I will make one, and ONLY ONE, follow recommendation per Friday. For more information, the Library of Congress recommends <a href="/2009/06/10/fussy-follow-friday/" target="_self">this blog post</a>._

<a href="https://twitter.com/erinjshea" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5359 alignright" style="margin: 3px 5px;" title="erinjshea" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/erinjshea-300x225.jpg" alt="erinjshea" width="210" height="158" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/erinjshea-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/06/erinjshea.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a>Today&#8217;s Fussy Follow Friday recommendation is&#8230;.<a href="https://twitter.com/erinjshea" target="_blank">@erinjshea</a>, who is married to an old #followfriday standby of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/ourmaninchicago" target="_blank">@ourmaninchicago</a>. She has other redeeming qualities as well, however.

For me to recommend others to follow someone, that person needs to hit two main criteria &#8211; hilarity and relevance. (Don&#8217;t hold me to this criteria, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll change them in the future, but for now, this is what I&#8217;m going with, and it works. Deal with it.) <a href="https://twitter.com/erinjshea" target="_blank">@erinjshea</a> has both of these in spades. Her tweets include the links to posts on her <a href="https://ejshea.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>, which is both insightful and frank. She also includes the occasional Tom Waits reference, and is not above using her Twitter powers to take the piss out of @ourmaninchicago, but in a very obviously loving way. I think.

Why should you follow <a href="https://twitter.com/erinjshea" target="_blank">@erinjshea</a>? It&#8217;s simple &#8211; there&#8217;s a glut of useless crap out there in the Twitterverse. @erinjshea does not equal crap. Therefore, your Twitter experience will improve tenfold if you start following her. I guarantee it. If not, you can simply return her Tweets to your place of purchase for a full refund. Receipt required &#8211; what do you think this is, Target?
