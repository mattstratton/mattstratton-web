Here&#8217;s how this works. Leave a comment to this entry, and I will answer the following questions about you.

I won&#8217;t even make you promise to repost in your own LJ &#8211; how about this instead: You reply to my reply with your answers about me to the same question. Make sense?

1. Tell you why I friended you.
  
2. Associate you with something &#8211; a song, a color, a photo, etc.
  
3. Tell you something I like about you.
  
4. Tell you a memory I have of you.
  
5. Associate you with a character.
  
6. Ask something I&#8217;ve always wanted to know about you.
  
7. Tell you my favorite user picture of yours.
  
8. You then reply to my comment, with your answers to questions 1-7
