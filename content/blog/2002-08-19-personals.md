So I was just having a conversation with a friend of mine about personal ads.

It&#8217;s interesting how personals work for some people and not others.

I&#8217;ve never had good luck with personals&#8230;and I think I know why.

I don&#8217;t come accross well &#8220;on paper&#8221;. If I look at the list of things that people say they &#8220;don&#8217;t want&#8221;, a lot of it fits me. I&#8217;m divorced, have a son, am a smoker, and am not hugely financially successful (well, not anymore).

So I think when one is playing the &#8220;ordering out of a catalog&#8221; game that is the personals, I get relegated to the bit bucket.

Which means that it&#8217;s not a good tool for me. I&#8217;m better off in other forms, when the gal gets a chance to see how funny I am, or interesting, or whatever, rather than just &#8220;vital stats&#8221;.

Which I think I like better anyway.
