We just got home from [Bike the Drive][1]. We didn&#8217;t do the entire route, but we started at Grant Park, rode up to the Bryn Mawr turnaround, then headed back. We exited at Fullerton and rode home from there.

Once [Motionbased][2] stops being a pain the ass, I will upload the course from my GPS and you can see how cool we are.

More pictures!
