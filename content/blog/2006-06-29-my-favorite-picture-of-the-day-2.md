Your pal and mine, [Trapper][1], posted this picture in his blog.

_So what sort of things do a dad and daughter do when they stay home together? Why practice flying of course! It is pretty hard to get a shot like this when you are home by yourself.</p>

It totally cracks me up. Impressive photog skillz, yo.
