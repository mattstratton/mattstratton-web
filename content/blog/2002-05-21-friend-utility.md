A while ago, I saw something in someone&#8217;s LJ that showed a tool for matching friends.

It wasn&#8217;t the &#8220;Six Degrees of Separation&#8221; tool&#8230;but rather, one that told you all sorts of things about a user. Like, how many people they listed as friends who didn&#8217;t list them as friends, etc.

Anyone have any idea what I&#8217;m talking about?
