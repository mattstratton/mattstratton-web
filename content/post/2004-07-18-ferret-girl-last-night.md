I posted this as a reply to something <span class="ljuser"><a href="https://belcanto88.livejournal.com/"><strong>belcanto88</strong></a></span> said, but I felt like putting it into its own entry.

[Ferret Girl][1] was in the city for her friend&#8217;s show, and wanted to get together. So she ended up stopping by and hanging out having beers in the yard with me, Tracy, Brian, and Kevin. After everyone went to bed we sat around talking about improv theory for another hour or two.

Then she went home. I never quite know how to play it with her, because she&#8217;s freakin&#8217; whackadoo. There probably could have been mild fooling around, but I don&#8217;t feel like I want to do that. If that makes sense. I mean, fooling around is fine and all. But I do really like her, even though I know I shouldn&#8217;t, and I generally don&#8217;t lose sleep over it, but still, it&#8217;s like, if she can&#8217;t be my girlfriend, I&#8217;m okay with her being my friend, but not a fooling around friend.

If that makes sense.
