Thing the first:

I was riding home from work yesterday, and as I was coming over the bridge on Damen (about 3 miles from home), I was coming up to a red light. So I started to slow down, and heard someone behind me honk.

I got ready to turn around and give them my cyclist version of the bird (aka &#8220;wave and smile&#8221;), thinking &#8220;who&#8217;s this jackass who&#8217;s honking at me while I stop for a light?&#8221;

But it was Carrie, driving home from work. Ha! I kept pace with her for quite a while &#8211; but then she caught a light at Roscoe that I missed, and that was the end of that. Still, she only got home about five minutes before I did.

Secondly, I would like to point something out to all of you out there. Just because your boyfriend/fiancee/husband will watch _Gilmore Girls_ with you does NOT mean he has ANY interest in watching _The View_.

That is all.
