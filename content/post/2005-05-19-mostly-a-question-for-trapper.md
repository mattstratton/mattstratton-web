So, it&#8217;s been years since I&#8217;ve owned a gaming console.

But I kind of want to get one. What I want is a really good baseball game. A friend of mine offered to sell me his Xbox, but I don&#8217;t know much about them. So my question is&#8230;what&#8217;s the best baseball video game out there these days?
