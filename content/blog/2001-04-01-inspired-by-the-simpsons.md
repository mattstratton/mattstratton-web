I was watching The Simpsons tonight. It was actually a pretty disappointing episode (Homer and the family go on safari in Africa), but it made me think.

I had been planning on spending my signing bonus on a big screen tv. &#8220;But,&#8221; thought I. &#8220;What if, instead, I spend it on a cool adventure type trip, such as to Africa or Australia?&#8221;

So I did some very, VERY preliminary research. And here is what I found: it&#8217;s almost impossible to find plane fares to Botswana. I just wanted to find a ballpark price&#8230;but no such luck.

My cable modem is being flaky tonight. It keeps disconnecting, which is making it difficult for me to carry on my IM conversation w/ Flash (inspired by Heidi, I&#8217;m going to use cool code names for people. Even though nobody is gonna read this).
