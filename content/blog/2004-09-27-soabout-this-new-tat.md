So I&#8217;ve been bugging to draw me my new tattoo for a while. And now that she&#8217;s doing it, I have some questions about placement, reactions, etc.

First, some background: this will be my third tattoo. The first one is a small lizard on my left ankle. The second is a pinup girl on my right bicep. The proposed third tattoo is a pinup version of an angel holding a cigarette and a beer.

reminded me to also point out that my back is kind of hairy. Thanks, Kim.

Please feel free to additionally post any input/comments you might have on this subject. Thanks all.
