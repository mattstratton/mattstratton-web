So I did this like a year ago&#8230;and some things just haven&#8217;t changed&#8230;

You can make LJ tell you which users match up to you the most&#8230;just hop to http://www.livejournal.com/interests.bml?mode=findsim_do&user=mugsy1274, but replace &#8220;mugsy1274&#8221; with your LJ name.

Each matching user gets computed a magic index, which is a weighting of two factors: the raw number of like interests, and some extra points for sharing uncommon interests.

So here&#8217;s the people on my &#8220;friends&#8221; list that match up&#8230;

1. &#8211; 28.595 (she was tops then, and she&#8217;s still tops)

4. &#8211; 24.799 (I guess we indie filmmaker nerds are all alike)

26. &#8211; 19.855 (I think this is how I found her to be on my friends list in the first place)

33. &#8211; 18.494 ( _know_ this is how he ended up on m list)

80. &#8211; 16.098 (she&#8217;s moved up from 11.214 a year ago)

In case you&#8217;re wondering&#8230;here is the list of interests that and I have in common:

david sedaris
  
frank sinatra
  
humor
