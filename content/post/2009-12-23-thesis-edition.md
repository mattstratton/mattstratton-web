As I mentioned before, I&#8217;ve recently switching my blog over to using the super-mergatroid-flexible WordPress theme of <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=198392&U=404372&M=24570" target="_blank">Thesis</a>. And no, I didn&#8217;t just do it because <a href="http://doniree.com" target="_blank">Doniree</a> did. Well, maybe.

Today I am dusting off the Web Wanderings to provide you with some cool links that are Thesis-related. Maybe you already are using Thesis and want to know how to make it more awesome. Or perhaps you&#8217;re considering Thesis and need a little more info. One thing is for sure&#8230;I&#8217;m getting tired of typing the word &#8220;Thesis&#8221; already!

<a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=198392&U=404372&M=24570" target="_blank"><strong>Thesis Theme For WordPress</strong></a> &#8211; Might as well start at the top. Here&#8217;s where you can find the overview of what the theme can do, and if you so choose, pick up a copy for yourself. The DIYThemes folks really make a point of providing video content explaining everything that Thesis is capable of&#8230;I highly recommend watching at least the initial overviews.

<a href="http://wpblogger.com/free-thesis-skin-photographers-exhibit.php" target="_blank"><strong>Free Thesis Skin for Photographers: Exhibit</strong></a> &#8211; I&#8217;ve decided to install this skin on my (work in progress, mind you) photoblog, <a href="http://strattonstudio.com/" target="_blank">Stratton Studio</a>. It took quite a bit of hoop-jumping to get this going, but I really think it&#8217;s neat. You can take a <a href="http://strattonstudio.com/" target="_blank">look for yourselves</a>, but bear in mind that I&#8217;m still working on it. Did I mention that it&#8217;s not complete yet?

<a href="http://www.emptycabinmedia.com/thesis-feature-box/" target="_blank"><strong>Thesis feature box – How to show off your best articles</strong></a> &#8211; One of the improvements I&#8217;m making with my blog is the concept of &#8220;featured content&#8221;. I&#8217;ve started by just listing the &#8220;featured&#8221; articles in the sidebar, but there is so much more that can be done. I have been experimenting with either using the method described in this link here, or the one below.

<a href="http://www.billerickson.net/wordpress-thesis-featured-content-rotator/" target="_blank"><strong>Thesis Tip #5 – Featured Content Rotator</strong></a> &#8211; Another method of implementing Featured Content in the Thesis framework. Fundamentally similar to the approach above, but a slightly different method is used here. Still, super cool stuff.

<a href="http://www.pearsonified.com/2007/04/definitive-guide-to-semantic-markup.php" target="_blank"><strong>The Definitive Guide to Semantic Web Markup for Blogs</strong></a> &#8211; This isn&#8217;t a Thesis-specific link, but it&#8217;s written by the Thesis guy (and I found it from the Thesis site). Thesis, Thesis, Thesis! Anyway, I highly recommend any blogger who is interested in increasing SEO take a stroll through this post. Chris Pearson explains VERY clearly how the markup in your posts will affect how it is interpreted semantically by search engines, among other things. Fascinating stuff. A must-read.

_Any of you using Thesis and have links to cool tips and tricks? Share them in the comments, may you please&#8230;_
