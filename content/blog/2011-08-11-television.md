This is the one where I talk about TV.



First of all, I had to leave a bunch of my favorite shows out, because of time constraints. And I also realized after the fact that I had forgotten a ton of my favorites as well, in addition to the ones I remembered to say something about, but cut out.

Here are a few TV shows that I love(d), that didn&#8217;t make it into the video:

  * _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_
  * _Battlestar Galactica_
  * _It&#8217;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia_
  * _Mad Men_
  * _30 Rock_
  * _Friends_
  * _Absolutely Fabulous_
  * _The State_
  * _Greg the Bunny_
  * _The Big Bang Theory_
  * _Lost_
  * _The X-Files_
