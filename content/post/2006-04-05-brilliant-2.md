Some dude made a bet with his girlfriend that if his website gets 2,000,000 hits by next April 1st, she&#8217;ll have a threesome with him.

He&#8217;s up to about 8,000 so far.

Go help him out!

**Edit** &#8211; yes, I realize it&#8217;s just an attempt to get people to sign up to that dating site via his affiliate link, but I still think it&#8217;s worthy of discussion, since encouraging internet people to have threesomes is a noble cause.
