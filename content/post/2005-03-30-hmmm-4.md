Improv girl might be a little flaky&#8230;

Steph: want to hear a story that&#8217;s gonna make me sound kinda flakey&#8230;
  
Mugsy: sure!
  
Steph: but really is just the story of a girl looking for her place in the world&#8230;
  
Steph: well&#8230;
  
Steph: my mom called me yesterday to tell me that a guy i was good friends with as a kid, through high school, (he was my first &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; when we were preteens), has just become the principal of a new charter school opening in cincinnati, and is looking for teachers&#8230;
  
Steph: to be a charter school teacher, you don&#8217;t need an education degree, just a bachelors, and to pass a state cert test
  
Steph: so i&#8217;m applying!
  
Mugsy: neat
  
Mugsy: well, except for the cincinnati part :)
  
Steph: i&#8217;ve always wanted to be a teacher (the path not taken)
  
Steph: yeah, but that&#8217;s where my family is, and a lot of my college friends are still there
  
Steph: and really, i feel like i have no major ties to chicago, no family, husband, career, etc

The reason I said she&#8217;s flaky, is that just the other day, she was talking about going to NYC for a week for an immersive video editing course.
