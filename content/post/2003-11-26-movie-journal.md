I am going to keep a journal of my filmmaking. Well, I have already, but I think I need to do it more religiously. It will be &#8220;friends-only&#8221; for now, since a lot of this stuff is &#8220;work in progress&#8221;. Actually, I might maybe need to keep it more secure than that. So I will set up a filter. If you want to be included on the filter, send me an email at [matt [at] gravytrainfilms [dot] com][1], and I will add you.

**Update: I&#8217;ve decided to create a new journal called which is where this journal would be. So if you want to read it, first add that journal to your &#8220;friends&#8221; page, and then post in the first entry there requesting I add you. If I know and trust you, you&#8217;ll be added.</p>
