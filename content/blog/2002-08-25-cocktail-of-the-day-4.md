This is the recipe I use for Long Islands&#8230;I know that others make them differently. I like this one &#8211; it tastes just like iced tea! But be advised there there&#8217;s a substantial amount of booze in here, so proceed with caution.

**Long Island Iced Tea**

2 oz. Sour Mix
  
1/2 oz. vodka
  
1/2 oz. gin
  
1/2 oz. light rum
  
1/2 oz. light tequila
  
1/2 oz. Triple Sec

Blend in mix cup with ice. Pour into iced Collins glass. Fill with cola. Garnish with lemon wedge.

_Variations:_
  
Long Beach Lemonade &#8211; Fill with cranberry juice instead of cola.
  
Electric Lemonade &#8211; Fill with 7-Up instead of cola
  
Sky Blue Electric Lemonade (aka &#8220;Blue Motherfucker&#8221;) &#8211; Substitute Blue Curacao for the Triple Sec, and fill with 7-Up instead of cola.
