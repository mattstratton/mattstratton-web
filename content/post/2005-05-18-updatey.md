For some reason, I haven&#8217;t felt much like blogging lately. Dunno why.

Had a good time in NYC. Did a spot of shopping in the East Village with Ryan. Had drinks in Brooklyn for &#8216;s birthday. Went to that dancer auction thing and bought some manflesh. Went to the Mets game. Got myself around pretty well on the subway.

Saw <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hitchiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy</span> last night with Tom. I enjoyed it immensely. I haven&#8217;t read the books in quite a while, but I always liked them. And I found this to be a movie that brought some good funnay. I would have liked to have seen it with a larger audience, for pure feedback laughs, but still, good stuff. Mos Def was great. Alan Rickman was perfection. And I think Parker and Liz have to move over and make room for Zooey.

Tomorrow night going to see <span style="font-style:italic;">Star Wars</span> with and Tom. And a player to be named later (I have an extra ticket). Good times.

I&#8217;m tired.
