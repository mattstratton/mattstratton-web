Over the past 18 plus months we&#8217;ve played games with having &#8220;relations&#8221; on a specific schedule (whether we wanted to or not), injected more needles than Sammy Sosa, and moved genetic material around in all kinds of random ways.

And it&#8217;s finally paid off.

Yes. For reals.

We are going to be parents.

But wait, there&#8217;s more&#8230;

We are having TWINS.

As I told my friend Marcelo last night &#8211; it&#8217;s not so much a matter of &#8220;slipping one past the goalie&#8221; as much as &#8220;body checking the goalie and whipping two pucks into the net at once&#8221;. But it worked.

The Stratton twins will be joining this world circa January 2010.

As you might expect, we are super excited about this. It&#8217;s quite a shock to have two for the price of one, although really it&#8217;s like double the cost of what we had planned. In the same conversation referenced above, Marcelo told me that we should have our own reality show. I said &#8220;Yes. It will be called _Matt and Carrie Plus Two Minus Money_.&#8221; We&#8217;re doing research on all things we DO need two of&#8230;and what we don&#8217;t. Fortunately, Carrie&#8217;s cousin has twins, so we&#8217;re getting a lot of great knowledge from her. And the internets&#8230;bless the internets&#8230;

But yeah. We&#8217;re jumping ahead and having two at once. They are fraternal, but we won&#8217;t know their gender for a few months. But feel free to start the pool &#8211; I just ask that you give the house a 5% cut on all bets. We have names in mind as well, but only for a boy and a girl &#8211; if we have double-up gender, we need to do more thinking. And I&#8217;m not telling you what the names are yet. You can try to guess if you want though.

We want to thank all of you for your love and support through all of this. It&#8217;s been a rough road, and our friends and family are all too aware of this. But now, the good news is, you can stop hearing us talk endlessly about infertility.

Now you get to hear us talk endlessly about multiples.
