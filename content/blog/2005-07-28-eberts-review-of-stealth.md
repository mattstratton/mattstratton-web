Oh my.

This review made me laugh so hard. This has got to be one of the funniest movie reviews I&#8217;ve ever read.

Full review found <u>**[here][1]**</u>.

Some highlights:

_&#8216;Stealth&#8221; is a offense against taste, intelligence and the noise pollution code_
  
&#8230;
  
_In a movie that uses unexplained phrases like &#8220;quantum sponge,&#8221; why not just let the characters say &#8220;prime number&#8221; and not explain it? Many audience members will assume &#8220;prime number&#8221; is another one of those pseudo-scientific terms they&#8217;re always thinking up for movies like this._
  
&#8230;
  
_Lightning strikes the UCAV, which goes nuts and starts to download songs from the Internet. &#8220;How many?&#8221; &#8220;All of them.&#8221;_ 
  
&#8230;
  
_Soon all four of them are having lunch, and the three pilots are discussing military secrets in front of the Thai girl, who &#8220;doesn&#8217;t speak English.&#8221; Beautiful Thai girls who allow themselves to be picked up by U.S. pilots almost always speak English, but never mind. It&#8217;s not that Purcell is too stupid to know that trusting her is dangerous; it&#8217;s that the movie is too stupid. How stupid? Nothing happens. The girl can&#8217;t speak English._
