Went on a date last night with a girl from the online personal jackamoo thing.

It was one of the dullest dates I&#8217;ve been on in recent memory. Not saying she was a horrible person or whatever&#8230;but man, there was NO spark there. I might have been a little distracted, but still&#8230;just nothing. Nada. Zippo.

I&#8217;ve gotten responses from two other girls that seem more intriguing&#8230;I wrote back to them, but neither has replied to my reply yet. Hmph.
