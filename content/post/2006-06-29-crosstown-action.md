Tomorrow afternoon I will be at Wrigley with a few work friends, sitting up in the nosebleeds, for the Cubs/Sox game. Looks like it will be a bee-yoo-ti-ful day, and Sean Marshall is pitching. I love that kid. Our group is evenly mixed &#8211; two Sox fans and two Cubs fans. And hell, it beats working.

Saturday, thanks to my awesome friend [Heather][1], I will be returning to Wrigley with Carrie and her friend Katy (and HER friend) to see Greg Maddux hurl at the South Siders.

I love baseball, even though the Cubs are absolute SHIT right now.
