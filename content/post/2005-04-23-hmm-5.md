So I went out tonight with some friends to the Turtle Races (I&#8217;ll explain later) at Big Joe&#8217;s.

Cocker Spaniel met up with us. But right before she showed up, this girl came and said hi to me&#8230;turns out it was Julie, the girl I took to prom (and pretty much haven&#8217;t seen since, except for a brief encounter when she auditioned for _Gaia_).

So Julie and I chatted for a while on and off. At one point, Cocker Spaniel said &#8220;that girl is CUTE! You want me to talk to her for you? I think she&#8217;s into you.&#8221; Of course, I demurred. It does turn out that Julie is going to be in NYC the same weekend as the Cubs game (she&#8217;s going to one of the games), but since I was trying to not screw things up with Cocker Spaniel, I didn&#8217;t get her number or anything. Hmm.

Still not sure about the Spaniel. We&#8217;re going to the Cubs game on Sunday. It was nice to spend time with her tonight though. Chris thinks she&#8217;s into me. I&#8217;m not sure &#8211; although he did say he thought \*I\* didn&#8217;t like HER. Hm. More things to ponder.
