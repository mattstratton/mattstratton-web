So after about an hour and a half of sitting in the &#8220;virtual waiting room&#8221;, I was able to get in and buy some Cubs tickets.

I got four seats to the White Sox/Cubs game on Friday, June 30 @ 1:20 PM. They&#8217;re way the hell up in the upper deck, but oh well.

Opening Day was sold out, which kind of sucked. I&#8217;m back in the waiting room again (you can only buy one game at a time), so hopefully I&#8217;ll grab another set for another cool game.

Edit: A few minutes after posting this, I got in again. Couldn&#8217;t get seats to any Cardinals/Cubs or Astros/Cubs games, so I settled for a pair of seats for a Saturday game vs. Detroit. Good enough.
