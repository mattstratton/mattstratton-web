Inspired by the glamorous <a href="https://swifty0682.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">Swifty</a>, I have decided to take on the [52 Weeks Project][1]. Similar to the [365 Days Project][2], but with far less committment, this is a photography &#8220;assignment&#8221;, so to speak, which results in one self-portrait a week for a year&#8230;ultimately, 52 portraits.

You can watch my progress on Flickr, but I think I&#8217;ll be posting each week&#8217;s portrait here as well.
