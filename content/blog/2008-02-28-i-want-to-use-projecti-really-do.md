I&#8217;m trying to come up with a solution for resource planning for my team. I&#8217;m thinking that Project is probably going to be a good tool for me to use, but I&#8217;m having a hard time figuring out how to morph it into my actual needs.

Here&#8217;s the background of what I&#8217;ve got and what I&#8217;m trying to accomplish:

> My team consists of three people &#8211; one manager (who is also hands-on), one senior sysadmin, and one sysadmin. Generally speaking, all team members have the same responsibilities (listed below), with the exception of me (manager) who is only about 50% dedicated to these responsibilities, but can be assigned to any of them.
> 
> Team members split time (theoretically 50/50) between project work and operations
> 
> One sysadmin is assigned specifically to a project
> 
> What I want to be able to do is book 50% of time to ops, and then using the remainder of the available time for the person, assign them to the projects. I don&#8217;t need a lot of detail on the projects &#8211; for example, I know I am working on the Widget Upgrade project, which will start on March 1 and finish up April 15. I would like to be able to adjust the amount of hours per week (for example, the first week of the project I might have 8 hours of work, but other weeks I might only have 2 hours per week, with the last week being 12 hours, or something like that).

I can&#8217;t quite muddle out how to get this to work in Project. I know how to use Project for, well, projects, but this kind of on-going thing is really messing with my heads. Any MS Project gurus out there that can point me in the right direction?

(I&#8217;m using Project 2007, if it makes a difference).
