Just got my review from my boss. This has nothing to do with money, so it&#8217;s not that important, but in case you care, here&#8217;s what he had to say:

_Matt has continued to be a steady performer for the implementation team, delivering quality projects within projected timeframes. Matt is a team player and on multiple occasions has stepped up to take on additional projects to help the team. Matt is constantly trying to find a better way to do things. He had worked on automation to help the team eliminate the mundane tasks that suck up so much time. He has also worked very hard to clarify and improve process and procedures to assure consistent project delivery._

_Matt is never shy about pointing out a problem with a particular project or process. Matt brings issues to management attention in a timely manner so that projects don’t run astray. Matt’s confidence has only grown from the time that he had been hired into the bank._

_3+_

_Customer focus
  
Team player
  
Automation and process_

_3-_

_Time management
  
New technology knowledge
  
Detail oriented_ 

Well, it&#8217;s nice to be appreciated.
