This is the only picture I&#8217;ve taken so far, and it&#8217;s not that interesting. But Carrie and I are rocking out in Orlando. It&#8217;s kind of nice here.

We sat out by the pool and went swimming. It&#8217;s supposed to thunderstorm tonight. Tomorrow we&#8217;re going to Islands of Adventure, and on Sunday we&#8217;re (hopefully) going to the beach, and having dinner with Grandma Bea. On Monday we&#8217;ll be at Universal Studios and then heading homeward.
