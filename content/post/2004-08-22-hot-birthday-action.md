So yesterday a big group of us (including , , and ) heading up to the wilds of Kenosha to venture into the craziness of the Cracker Barrel and &#8220;Action&#8221; Territory (which is some kind of go kart/mini golf paradise, as opposed to Some Kind of Robot).

It was the most awesome. It was also the most tiring. It&#8217;s pretty amazing that we entertained ourselves there for over five hours, and it only cost $15. And there was no booze. Amazing.
