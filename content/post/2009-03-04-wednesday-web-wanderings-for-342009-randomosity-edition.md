Our theme this week is&#8230;no theme at all. Sometimes I just like to share random links that I think are full of awesome. 

**<a href="http://airplanelandingfield.org/bsg/BSG%20SpaceTimeline.jpg" target="_blank">Battlestar Galactica Timeline</a>** &#8211; For those of you who enjoy BSG, here&#8217;s a link to a JPG that displays a timeline of events/locations starting with the &#8220;birth of humanity&#8221; on Kobol, and it is complete up to March 1, 2009. This does contain spoilers, so don&#8217;t blame me if you read it and have things ruined for you. I only recommend checking this link out if you are up-to-date on the current season of Battlestar.

**<a href="http://woodgears.ca/eyeball/" target="_blank">The Eyeballing Game</a>** &#8211; One of many great ways to while away the hours when you should be working. The premise of this game is simplicity itself; how accurately can you &#8220;eyeball&#8221; angles, circles, parallelograms, and triangles?

**<a href="http://www.smalltime.com/Dictator" target="_blank">Guess the Dictator/Sitcom Character</a>** &#8211; An oldie, but a goodie. Pick your favorite dictator or sitcom character, and this website will figure out who you are thinking of, based upon your answers to various questions. It&#8217;s pretty hilarious. 

**<a href="http://beauty.about.com/od/hairstylephotogalleries/qt/photopose.htm" target="_blank">How To Look Thinner In Photos</a>** &#8211; A slew of tips on how to make yourself appear more attractive and not a hefty pudgefactory when your friends/family are snapping zillions of shots of you with their fancy new dSLR.

**<a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-avoid-blown-out-flash-in-photos" target="_blank">How To Avoid Blown Out Flash In Photos</a>** &#8211; Speaking of photography, this short video from <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com" target="_blank">Digital Photography School</a> helps you make your photos looks less like snapshots and more like photography. And that makes us all very happy.
