# About Matt Stratton

Matt Stratton is a Transformation Specialist at Red Hat and a long-time member of the global DevOps community. Back in the day, his license plate actually said “DevOps”.

Matt has over 20 years of experience in IT operations, ranging from large financial institutions such as JPMorganChase to internet firms including Apartments.com. He is a sought-after speaker internationally, presenting at Agile, DevOps, and ITSM focused events, including DevOps Enterprise Summit, DevOpsDays, Interop, PINK, and others worldwide. Matt is the founder and co-host of the popular [Arrested DevOps](https://www.arresteddevops.com) podcast, as well as a global organizer of the [DevOpsDays](https://www.devopsdays.org) set of conferences.

He lives in Chicago and has three awesome kids, whom he loves just a little bit more than he loves *Doctor Who*. He is currently on a mission to discover the best phở in the world.
