I just have to comment really quickly on this.

I was having kind of a &#8220;eh&#8221; birthday. This is no secret. However, Carrie made me a nice dinner last night. Including strawberry rhubarb pie (what I always had for my birthday growing up). And she gave me some really nice presents.

She gave me:

1) A gift certificate to H&M (I&#8217;ve been meaning to go shopping there)
  
2) A Tom Jones CD
  
3) A pack of Sprecher&#8217;s root beer.

See, Sprecher&#8217;s is my favorite root beer. And it&#8217;s kind of hard to find. I only know a couple places that serve it. Well apparently, you can buy it at the Binny&#8217;s a block from my house. So not only did she get me the root beer I love, she told me where I can get more. That&#8217;s awesome.

Some of the best presents ever. Right up there with the gifts I&#8217;ve gotten from MK in the past.
