Last night was really fun.

First, my family came into the city so we could take my mom out for her birthday. We went to Barnum and Bagels in Skokie &#8211; which creeped my sister out because of all the clowns, apparently. Then the fam came back to my house to provide me with care packages and a trash can, and toe check out the new pad. I think they approve.

After that, Tracy called me and invited me out to a movie with her and Chris. We went to see _The Quiet American_. Which was really pretty good. Afterwards, we went to Parrots to discuss the flick and then we talked for a couple hours about ideas for _Inventing: Stephen_. It was such a great movie night. And I really really REALLY enjoying discussing _The Quiet American_ with them; it was so much fun and so stimulating to have that discussion. I miss it.

I&#8217;m jealous of them; they go see a LOT of movies together (I could tell, because Tracy could identify the Fandango commercial before we entered the theater, and was singing along with it). I need a girlfriend who is into movies.
