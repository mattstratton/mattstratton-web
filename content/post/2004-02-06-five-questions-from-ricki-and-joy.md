As asked by

_1. What thing do you most regret not doing?_
  
Besides you? I would say I most regret not postponing production on DWG until I got my severence bonus from my job; by not waiting, I ended up spending a ton of money on the movie, and then got laid off. If I&#8217;d waited, maybe the movie wouldn&#8217;t have been made as quickly, but I wouldn&#8217;t have had months and months of debt. But then again&#8230;who knows if I&#8217;d ever have made the movie? So maybe I don&#8217;t regret that after all.

_2. If someone gave you a plane ticket anywhere in the world with the stipulation that you had to return a day later, where would you go?_
  
Vegas. For serious, it&#8217;s the only place I&#8217;d want to go to just spend a day. Anyplace too far, and you&#8217;d have jet lag to deal with and you wouldn&#8217;t enjoy yourself. I could easily spend just one day in Vegas. I would say Hawaii, because I&#8217;ve always wanted to go there, but since I don&#8217;t know anything or anywhere there, I&#8217;d waste my first day looking for a map.

_3. If you had endless financial support and you didn&#8217;t care what people thought when they saw it (because you&#8217;re just that good), what would the topic of your next movie be about? Or, what&#8217;s the coolest topic for a movie you couldn&#8217;t afford to make?_
  
For serious, I would love to do a Frankie Mannie biopic. But the budget is way way WAY out of my league.

_4. What&#8217;s something a girl could do where you&#8217;d say, &#8220;That&#8217;s the girl for me,&#8221; even if you didn&#8217;t know here?_
  
Order a root beer float and recite all the words to &#8220;Paul Revere&#8221; by the Beastie Boys.

_5. Do you ever wish you were a porn star?_
  
&#8220;Wish&#8221;?

As asked by

_1. When you were a kid (at any age), what did you want to be when you grew up?_
  
For a long time, I thought I wanted to be a photojournalist.

_2. What&#8217;s your favorite ice cream flavor?_
  
Heath Bar Crunch (or whatever it&#8217;s called)

_3. What sparked your interest in &#8220;going back&#8221; to Judaism?_
  
Well, ever since my maternal grandparents passed away, I wanted to re-connect with that part of my identity. When my friend Noel was going through conversion, he found out I was a Jew, and started talking to me about all this hard-core Hebrew school stuff&#8230;so he was kind of my &#8220;Jewish catalyst&#8221;.

_4. If you do break into a deal with a studio and get lots and lots of money and have creativity to spare and all that, what kind of car will you buy?_
  
That&#8217;s a good question! I think I want a Mini Cooper.

_5. If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be? (Notice that I ask this when it&#8217;s freezing in Chicago.)_
  
I would still live here. I love Chicago. But I&#8217;d really like to have a place in San Diego that I could go to in the winter :)
