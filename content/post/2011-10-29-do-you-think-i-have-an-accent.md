There&#8217;s a vlog meme running around, where people upload videos of themselves saying certain words or phrases, and then you, the viewer, identify the accent.

So here&#8217;s mine.



**_Say the following words:_**
  
Aunt, route, wash, oil, theatre, iron, salmon, caramel, fire, water, sure, data, ruin, crayon, toilet, New Orleans, pecan, both, again, probably, spitting image, Alabama, lawyer, coupon, mayonnaise, syrup, pajamas, caught

**_Answer these questions:_**
  
What is it called when you throw toilet paper on a house?
  
What is the bug that curls into a ball when you touch it?
  
What is the bubbly carbonated drink called?
  
What do you call gym shoes?
  
What do you say to address a group of people?
  
What do you call the kind of spider that has an oval-shaped body and extremely long legs?
  
What do you call your grandparents?
  
What do you call the wheeled contraption in which you carry groceries at the supermarket?
  
What do you call it when rain falls while the sun is shining?
  
What is the thing you use to change the TV channel?

So, what do you think?Â  Do I have an accent?
