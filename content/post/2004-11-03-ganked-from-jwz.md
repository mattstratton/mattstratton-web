Shamelessly stolen from

[Spider Jerusalem][1] on voting: &#8220;You want to know about voting. I&#8217;m here to tell you about voting. Imagine you&#8217;re locked in a huge underground night-club filled with sinners, whores, freaks and unnameable things that rape pitbulls for fun. And you ain&#8217;t allowed out until you all vote on what you&#8217;re going to do tonight. You like to put your feet up and watch &#8216;Republican Party Reservation&#8217;. They like to have sex with normal people using knives, guns, and brand new sexual organs you did not even know existed. So you vote for television, and everyone else, as far as your eye can see, votes to fuck you with switchblades. That&#8217;s voting. You&#8217;re welcome.&#8221; &#8212; Warren Ellis
