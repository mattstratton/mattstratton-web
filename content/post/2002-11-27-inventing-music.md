Went and checked out a location for &#8220;Inventing: Music&#8221; (the latest [GTF][1] project. It&#8217;s a short subject that we&#8217;re shooting on Dec 14 and 15.

Looks like we&#8217;ll be shooting the coffee shop scenes (the bulk of the action) at Big City Swing Studio. It&#8217;s a darling location, which will work perfectly. Except&#8230;the Green Line runs by the studio every five minutes. And apparently you can hear it. Good thing we&#8217;ll be running short takes. Jebus, who am I, Pete fucking Jones here?

I met with my cast (sans one actor, who was out of town for the holidays) on Monday night. I think we&#8217;re making some real headway with this script. With one exception, all of my actors are DWG alumni, so we&#8217;ve worked together before, which helps. My PD has some good ideas for the set dressing, and I&#8217;m really excited to see what Lippy does as DP.

One of the interesting things about I:M is our process. Dallas wrote the screenplay without any input from me (I didn&#8217;t even see it until it was in a revision draft phase), and I&#8217;ll be directing it. Then Dallas will edit it. Of course, since he doesn&#8217;t know how to use FCP, I&#8217;ll be doing the work, but I&#8217;m just going to be his arms and legs &#8211; he&#8217;s calling the shots, and I&#8217;m not gonna volunteer anything. But before he cuts the film, I&#8217;m going to make my own, &#8220;director&#8217;s cut&#8221;, if you will. We&#8217;re interested to see a) what happens when the writer cuts the film without the director&#8217;s input, and b) what the differences are between our cuts.

Knowing that someone other than me is going to be editing this without my input really affects how I will shoot it; if I wanted to, I could almost &#8220;force&#8221; Dallas to go down the road I want, with the footage I give him. But knowing that he&#8217;s going to need to have choices, I&#8217;m going to have to shoot a lot more than I need, if that makes any kind of sense.
