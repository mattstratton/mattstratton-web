We still desparately need a logo for [Straight Eye for the Queer Shows][1].

Many people keep offering that they would do one&#8230;but nobody ever does. We need it for the site, as well as t-shirt designs. If someone helps us out with this, we&#8217;ll pay you a nominal amount, as well as a piece of any t-shirt sales.

Email me at [matt [at] straighteye [dot] com][2] for more details. Thanks!
