So my good pal Zoe is gonna be in town this weekend.

I&#8217;m thinking we grab a bite to eat in Lakeview around 9 ish (her flight gets into Midway at 8), and then head to <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Improv Olympic</span> <a href="https://www.iochicago.net/" target="_blank">IO</a> for Baby Wants Candy at 10:30.

If you&#8217;re interested in joining us, let me know and I&#8217;ll get you the din-din details, or just meet us at IO at around 10:15 or so.
