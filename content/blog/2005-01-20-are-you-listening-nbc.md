Amandapance: better than Everybody (Doesn&#8217;t) Love(s) Raymond?
  
Mugsy: well, yes, better than that
  
Mugsy: but then again, my ass had a sitcom on abc, and it was better
  
Amandapance: your ass did?
  
Mugsy: it did
  
Mugsy: it was called &#8220;Living With Matt&#8217;s Ass&#8221;
  
Amandapance: wow.
  
Amandapance: what was that like?
  
Mugsy: it featured my ass as a down on its luck single father who just moved to san diego
  
Amandapance: haha
  
Mugsy: my ass had just started a new job as an architect, and had to deal with the duality of the dating scene while raising two rambunctious twins
  
Amandapance: sounds like a winner
  
Mugsy: if it got picked up, shana&#8217;s boobs were supposed to guest star as the wacky neighbor
