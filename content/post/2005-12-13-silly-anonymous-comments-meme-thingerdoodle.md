Anonymous comments to [you all][1]:

1. A wise man once said &#8220;redheads are nothin&#8217; but trouble. T-R-U-B-I-L.&#8221;

2. You&#8217;re quite saucy, and if you&#8217;ve really found a dude who can handle that extra gravy, that&#8217;s pretty sweet. I&#8217;m keeping my fingers crossed for you crazy kids.

3. I adore you in a mostly platonic way. You&#8217;re like that cousin who you really love, but is kind of hot, but you just keep forcing yourself to remember that it would be SO VERY WRONG.

4. I&#8217;m glad we finally got to meet this summer. You&#8217;re totally cute and a sweet girl. Good luck with your latest tribulations.

5. I&#8217;m so proud that my &#8220;little sister&#8221; is totally all grown up now.

6. I&#8217;m so proud that my little sister is totally all grown up now.

7. One day I&#8217;m gonna tell your kid stories about your drunk ass trashing my bathroom.

8. You&#8217;re seriously the funniest guy I know. Strangely enough, you&#8217;re also the coolest. And the dorkiest. I don&#8217;t know how that math works. Math is hard!

9. My life is better, and worse, for knowing you. Mostly better. Yeah, pretty much better. Okay, forget the &#8220;worse&#8221; part.

10. You&#8217;re a totally hot geeky chick, and we all know you control teh intarwebs, so stop frontin&#8217;.

11. We \*will\* be neighbors one day. For serious.

12. I&#8217;m glad we were able to reconnect this year. And especially glad you&#8217;ve found your groove.

13. I miss you. And that tubby bitch, too.

14. You&#8217;re probably my favorite new person that I met in 2005.

15. Can you believe we&#8217;ve been making snarky comments to each other for FIVE YEARS now? The mind boggles.

16. We have had some really great adventures together &#8211; in Chicago, in New York, and in various other cities of ill repute. I treasure them all. You&#8217;re really quite an interesting piece of work, and I&#8217;m glad to call you my friend. Plus, your wife is hot.

17. I still haven&#8217;t figured you out, but that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re so awesome.

18. Are you a boy or a girl?

19. I&#8217;m really glad we&#8217;ve become friends. You&#8217;re generous and true, as well as talented and other things. I&#8217;d say more, but you&#8217;d probably think I was coming on to you.

20. I keep forgetting that I&#8217;ve seen you topless. Like, twice. Secrets are fun.
