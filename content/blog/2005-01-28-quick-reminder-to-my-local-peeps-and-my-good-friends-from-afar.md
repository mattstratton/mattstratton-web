You may be aware that I run a [**swing dancing website**][1].

You may additionally be aware that we have an [**annual event**][2] for said website.

What you might not know is that this year, the event is on **Saturday, March 12**.

Also, this is the last one that I will be involved in. This will be the &#8220;retirement&#8221; party for myself and my partner, Jason, from running the site. For real.

So any of you who are in town, please attend. And I know some of you are even coming to town special for this. That means a lot to me.
