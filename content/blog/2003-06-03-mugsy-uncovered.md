_Here I am, interviewed by_ 

**1- How awesome was _The State_?**
  
_The State_ was one of the best sketch comedy shows of its time. Certainly one of the funniest things on MTV ever (sorry Colin Quinn, but _Remote Control_ just doesn&#8217;t match up to these wacky cats.) Some of the early signs of genius from this crew were noticeable in the short-lived _You Wrote It, You Watch It_, and the laughs continued somewhat on _Viva Variety_, but _The State_ is really the peak of their work.

**2- Did you know that Thomas Lennon is in the movie _A Guy Thing_**
  
I did not! That&#8217;s almost reason enough to watch it. Jerry Bruckheimer didn&#8217;t make that picture, did he? If not, I&#8217;ll rent it.

**3- How much pudding does $240 buy?**
  
Enough for you, me, and your slutty sorority sister.

**4- Have you ever had a perm?**
  
I have never had a perm. My hair is naturally wavy, in the way that women wish they had my hair, but it&#8217;s annoying as a guy.

**5- Is purple your favorite color?**
  
Not by a long shot. I like black. And red. In fact, I am currently wearing black pants and a burgandy shirt.

**To continue the fun:** If you want to be interviewed, comment in this post. I&#8217;ll give you the questions; you post them (with answers!) in your LJ, and then pass along the interviewing offer. Dig?
