I&#8217;ve been in festival-research mode for the past week or so&#8230;basically compiling a list of festivals that DWG and I:M are &#8220;matches&#8221; for.

One concern that Dallas and I had was regarding DVD sales and online presentation &#8211; would that count against us with the &#8220;premiere requirement&#8221; that a lot of festivals have?

The good news is that I have heard back from almost all the festivals that we want to enter, and they&#8217;re all totally cool with our film (in terms of premiere status). The only one that is a problem is Austin; DWG doesn&#8217;t qualify due to length, and they don&#8217;t want movies that have been Internet streamed. At first I thought that meant I:M was screwed. But then I realized&#8230;we have changed the movie since the posting on Triggerstreet, so I suppose we can always claim that the version on TS is a &#8220;work in progress&#8221; version :)

I&#8217;m excited. I&#8217;m sending in our first festival submission this week &#8211; _Inventing: Music_ is headed off to the <a href="http://asuartmuseum.asu.edu/filmfest/" target="_new">ASU Art Museum Short Film and Video Festival</a>.
