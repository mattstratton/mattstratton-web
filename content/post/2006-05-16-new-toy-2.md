To go along with my new phone, I broke down and bought a Bluetooth hands-free thingerdoodle &#8211; the [Jabra BT800][1].

I don&#8217;t intend to be one of the cybernerds who wander around everywhere like Lt. Uhuru with this thing clipped to their ears. It&#8217;s mostly for use on conference calls when working at home.

I figure I&#8217;ll also let Carrie play with this one, and see if she likes it. We need to get her something like this, or maybe one of the in-car speakerphone systems (I&#8217;m thinking one of the &#8220;no install&#8221; units like the [Motorola HF820][2]).

What do you guys think? Have any of you had experience with these things?
