[**Guilty Pleasures, Embarrassing Truths**][1]

<span class="copy">Here&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about:</p>

You whistle along to </i><i>Patience, and you’d rather watch “Fear Factor” than anything on the Discovery Channel. Welcome to club.</i></span>

This idea is so apeshit, bananas insane—and fetishistically weird—that reading it now I want to max-out my credit cards, declare bankruptcy, and move to Detroit where I would take up residency in a dumpster, drink Thunderbird all day, and yell out “Small Wonder!” to passing strangers until my premature death at the hands of full-blown something or other.</i> </span>
