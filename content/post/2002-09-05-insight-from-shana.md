So I was telling about this girl I&#8217;ve been chatting with on [Nerve][1]&#8230;

Mugsy: this one girl I am talking to on nerve sounds like someone out of my movie
  
Shanabanana: is that a good thing?
  
Mugsy: I am not sure
  
Mugsy: &#8220;I know who Gaia is because I was a women&#8217;s studies major AND I went to neo-hippie college. It wasn&#8217;t hard to adopt her to my own sense of freedom. Actually, her image is a part of a tattoo or two that I have.&#8221;
  
Shanabanana: that&#8217;s a bad thing
  
Shanabanana: if you feel opressed being around a vegan, you&#8217;ll definitely feel opressed by a woman&#8217;s studies major
