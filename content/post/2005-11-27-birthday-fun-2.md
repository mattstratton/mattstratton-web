Went to my mom&#8217;s house last night for a pre-birthday thingerdoodle (my birthday isn&#8217;t for another week and a half). Went shopping with my sister and mom (she got me a new coffee maker) and then had a nice Chinese dinner.

This is a picture of my sister, Debbie. More pictures from the evening can be found [here][1].
