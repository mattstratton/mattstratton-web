What a crappy weekend.

And none of the crappiness had anything to do with Valentine&#8217;s day.

First, my Powerbook died on Friday. It just gave up and whimpered, so I have to take it in for service.

Then today, the ATM down the street ate $380 of mine. Hopefully I will be able to straighten it out ONCE THE FUCKING BANKS OPEN AGAIN&#8230;HOW CAN YOU HAVE AN ATM WITHOUT 24 HOUR HELP LINE?

Seriously, every day I am more and more amazed at how much crap we let people and companies get away with in this country.
