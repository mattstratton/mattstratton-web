So I think the Fizz girl has, well, fizzled.

We went out to [IO][1] last night and then some drinks; it was fun, although once again I felt boring &#8211; like I had nothing interesting to say.

I walked her &#8220;home&#8221; to the L stop and she gave me an &#8216;air kiss&#8217;. Yeah. So I guess nothing is going to happen there. Oh well. On to the next one!
