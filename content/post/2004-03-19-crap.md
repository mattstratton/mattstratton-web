So I figured out that the reason my Powerbook has been crashing is \*not\* because it was dropped, but rather, it has a bad memory module.

I purchased a 512 MB module back in October from Accord Memory.

Of course, their website no longer comes up. I bet they are out of business. I just tried emailing them. I hope I can get it replaced.
