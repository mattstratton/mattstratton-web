Such a weekend I&#8217;ve had.

I came away feeling very rejected over the past few days. Each thing, if it was an isolated incident, would not be much. But having them all in such a short time span, really doesn&#8217;t do much for Mugsy&#8217;s ego, lemme tell ya.

One incident I can&#8217;t give too many details about, as some of you might know who I&#8217;m talking about. Let&#8217;s just leave it at as a female friend of mine who I \*thought\* I might be interested in&#8230;well, no longer, for sure. She basically seemed like spending ANY time with me this weekend was a trial. Which doesn&#8217;t make me feel good.

Second incident occured at the techno party last night. A certain young lady who is about as insane as they come was acting in her normal way towards me (which is act REALLY interested when I&#8217;m not, but disappear as soon as I show any kind of interest.). Earlier in the evening I really wasn&#8217;t talking to her much, just sort of making polite conversation. Which seemed to make her want to grind her ass on me. But later, if I would go over and talk to her, she&#8217;d walk away 30 seconds later. In retrospect, I actually find it humorous. But at the time, caused me to feel very rejected.

Finally, there&#8217;s a girl who we will call S, just because using pronouns is hard. S is someone I&#8217;ve been crushing on pretty hard for a while. And I thought she might be interested as well. Although recently she told me that she was not going to date for a while, and also implied that I might be more attractive if I lost weight (which is probably true). Anyway, I got to see her hanging all over another guy this weekend. And if I flirted with her at all, she just seemed &#8220;tolerant&#8221;. Again, it made me feel really shitty. And I don&#8217;t know what to do about it besides pout.

It would be nice if girls who weren&#8217;t dating someone or married would flirt with me and not act like I am either a) asexual or b) completely unappealing. I have lots of girls flirting with me. But they&#8217;re all taken.
