So I&#8217;m getting ready for the big Vegas trip&#8230;

I leave tomorrow morning at 6 AM. Going with a group of seven other guys&#8230;we&#8217;re gonna be kickin&#8217; it old school downtown&#8230;none of that Disney-fied Strip nonsense for us!

I&#8217;ll be back on Tuesday. It&#8217;s a long trip!

Just went to Border&#8217;s to pick up some reading material for the flight&#8230;got a new copy of _Stranger in a Strange Land_ (the uncut version; my copy has never come back from a loan), _Ain&#8217;t It Cool_ by Harry Knowles, and some fantasy fluff.
