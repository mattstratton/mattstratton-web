So my &#8220;Parker Posey Gift Set&#8221; arrived from Amazon.com today. Actually, it was just a bunch of DVD&#8217;s, three of which were Parker flicks (Clockwatchers, House of Yes, and Daytrippers).

Things are coming along really well for [The Black and Tan Fantasy][1]. We&#8217;ve gotten a lot of presales so far&#8230;we&#8217;re probably going to have to order more t-shirts. I hope we get the numbers we need, or [Windyhop][2] will go bye-bye&#8230;

I&#8217;m not happy with my haircut anymore. i really REALLY liked it at first&#8230;and after about a week and a half, it&#8217;s starting to look crappy again. I guess it&#8217;s gotten too long and the hair is too heavy for the paste to hold up or something&#8230;I guess with this style I&#8217;ll have to get my haircut every couple weeks. That&#8217;s insane.
