Just got home from seeing DJ Z-Trip rock out at the HOB with <span class="ljuser"><a href="https://jensantarelli.livejournal.com/"><strong>jensantarelli</strong></a></span>. DJ Goldenchild and Black Sheep opened, and they were pretty fun, but Z-Trip totally pwned the show.

Highlights included:

* Bringing a girl up on stage to play Pac Man while Z-Trip, his drummer, and Goldenchild &#8220;played along&#8221; with music

* Super dope images on the video screens, including a _Star Wars_ themed intro. I think the thing I love most about Z-Trip is that he seems like he&#8217;s a giant dork

* <span class="ljuser"><a href="https://mteson.livejournal.com/"><strong>mteson</strong></a></span> warned me that Z-Trip was pretty lame on the mic; I think he must have gotten better, but he&#8217;s still just as white as <span class="ljuser"><a href="https://gravytation.livejournal.com/"><strong>gravytation</strong></a></span>. And he kind of looks like him too.
