My cousin-in-law is pregnant with twin boys. This was very exciting news, and the entire family is super jazzed (there are very few boys on that side of the family, but I think everyone would be happy regardless). 

About a week ago (25 weeks pregnant), she went into the hospital because she was having what seemed to be contractions. Long story short, she (and her babies) have been diagnosed with <a href="http://www.fetalhope.org/page.php?id=32" target="_blank" class="postlink">Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS)</a>. This is very serious stuff, and we&#8217;re all really scared. 

If you are a praying kind of person, please keep my cousin in your prayers. If you&#8217;re not, please think nice thoughts anyway.
