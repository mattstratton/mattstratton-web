Not that anyone who reads my blog is the kind of jerk driver who tries to kill me on a daily basis, but maybe you could help pass this along to other drivers? Since nobody will probably even have the slightest idea about it?

<div style="margin-left:40px;">
  ILLINOIS &#8211; A new share-the-road traffic safety law in Illinois gives bicyclists a little more breathing room. </p> 
  
  <p>
    Senate Bill 80, which Gov. Rod Blagojevich signed into law last week, <span style="font-weight:bold;">requires motorists to make sure there is at least 3 feet of clearance to pass a bicycle rider. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also, the law says bicyclists may now signal a right turn with their right arm extended outward, instead of using the left arm to signal all traffic maneuvers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;They may now point where they&#8217;re going. That&#8217;s easier for drivers to understand,&#8221; said Ed Barsotti, executive director of the League of Illinois Bicyclists.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The new law also says bikes may move out farther into the traffic lane, where cars might turn right.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The goal is to prevent accidents in which right-turning drivers underestimate a bike&#8217;s speed, pass the cyclist then cut them off, Barsotti said.</div> 
    
    <p>
      Of course, just because it&#8217;s now illegal to pass a bike too closely, that&#8217;s not going to make a lick of difference to the drivers who think bikes should be ridden on the sidewalk, or are under the impression that bikes are legally required to ride in the bike lane at all times (and if there&#8217;s no bike lane, you shouldn&#8217;t ride your bike on that street).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And yes, I am fully aware that there are cyclists out there who blow red lights and stop signs and ride the wrong way on a one-way street. That doesn&#8217;t give you, a driver, license to try to kill me with a two ton weapon.

      ETA &#8211; someone on Yelp just sent me a link to a whole site outlining the City&#8217;s plans for restructuring bike infrastructure. Neat stuff &#8211; <a href="http://www.bike2015plan.org/chapter1/chap1_obj3.html">http://www.bike2015plan.org/chapter1/chap1_obj3.html</a>. Too bad we&#8217;ll probably be living in the suburbs by the time this all goes through.
