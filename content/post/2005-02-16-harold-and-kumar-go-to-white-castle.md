<p>
  I saw this last night courtesy of Netflix. I was expecting the a by-the-numbers dick and fart joke romp (what else to expect from a movie that advertised its stars as &#8220;that Asian guy from <span style="font-style:italic;">American Pie</span> and the Indian guy from <span style="font-style:italic;">Van Wilder</span>&#8220;?)
</p>

<p>
  I was pleasantly surprised. Like Danny Leiner&#8217;s previous film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dude, Where&#8217;s My Car?</span>, the movie was laced with sophmoric humor. But, underneath it all. lay a fairly biting social commentary on racial stereotyping and self-actualization.
</p>

<p>
  As stoner comedies go, this is the pinnacle.
</p>

<p>
  Plus, it&#8217;s worth a rental just to hear Neil Patrick Harris say &#8220;tripping balls&#8221;.</span></span>
