&#8230;in the job department.

No news from Bank One still. Talked to them today, and the recruiter was kind of like &#8220;well, haven&#8217;t heard anything new, but there&#8217;s some more positions coming open here in Columbus&#8221;.

The six month contract job I was all excited about fell apart as well. I can&#8217;t even get focus group shit now; all the ones I call I&#8217;m not qualified for.

And I never got called back from Starbucks, Barnes and Noble, or Border.

Yargh.
