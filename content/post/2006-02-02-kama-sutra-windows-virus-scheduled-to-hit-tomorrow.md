All you kids out there running Windows, be prepared for the onslaught of the **[Kama Sutra virus][1]**.

This virus has been distributing itself for a while, with a scheduled &#8220;attack&#8221; date of tomorrow (Friday, Feb 3, 2006).

If the virus gets installed on your computer, it attempts to disable your AV software, so running a specialized scanner is recommended (information below).

This virus scans your local drives (as well as network shares) for, among other things, Word and Excel files, which it then corrupts. I recommend backing up any really important files (financial records, etc) to removeable media (such as CD-R) before tomorrow.

You can download a scanner for this particular piece of malware from <u>**<https://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/nyxem_e.shtml>**</u>. Makesure that you also download <u>**<https://download.f-secure.com/latest/latest.zip>**</u> and save that zip file into the same location as the scanner.

Good night, and good luck.
