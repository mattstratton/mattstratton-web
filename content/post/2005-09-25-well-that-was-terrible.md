Just got back from date #2 with Jaymie.

Started out well, in my opinion. She showed up on time, for starters. We had sushi for dinner, and it was pretty good in my mind (the conversation, that is). We headed over to IO for the show, which I think she wasn&#8217;t too into (I wasn&#8217;t either, actually, as the first two teams were kinda teh suck). After the show I suggested going to get a drink, and she said &#8220;actually, after sitting down for so long, I kind of feel like I&#8217;ve lost my momentum.&#8221;

We talked for a few minutes more, I told her I was going out of town for a week, she told me she had job interviews tomorrow, etc. Then she said &#8220;Well, this was a lot of fun&#8221;, kissed me on the cheek, and said &#8220;See ya!&#8221; and left.

That was certainly worth a week of stressing over.
