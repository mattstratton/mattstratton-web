I apologize if this post is a bit disjointed. Just a collection of random thoughts for right now&#8230;perhaps I&#8217;ll consolidate into somethign more coherent later.

First, some overall impressions:

1) Link &#8211; fun new character. I dug on him. I also really liked the French program (whose name escapes me) and the &#8220;guardian&#8221; guy for the Oracle. He was fun.

2) A common speculation right now is that Zion is actually a Matrix. That the Matrix we&#8217;ve been exposed to so far is a Matrix within a Matrix. I&#8217;m currently subscribing to that theory, for reasons that will come up later in this post.

3) Another speculation is that the Council was the &#8220;26&#8221; from the previous version of the Matrix. I think that&#8217;s pretty much a given, and not really speculation. I personally wonder if the Councilor that had the scene with Neo at the Engineering Level was &#8220;The One&#8221; from the previous versions.

4) Poor Trinity. Such a strong character in the first flick, and now demoted to &#8220;Neo&#8217;s love interest&#8221;. She got a couple bad ASS fight scenes though. And that motorcycle chase was the BOMB! Especially knowing that Carrie-Ann Moss is scared SHITLESS of motorcycles, and for a lot of the scenes, that was HER on that Ducati.

Other thoughts:

I think everyone who was expecting great things bought into the hype. The first one was NOT a fantastic film. It was a fun movie that I really enjoy, but nothing really earth-shaking in terms of STORY.

I went into this one hoping for a good shoot-em-up with some laughs and Carrie-Ann Moss in a leather fighsuit, and was not disappointed.

Set your expectations realistically, folks.

Also, I think people are setting the bar WAY too high on the effects&#8230;I&#8217;ve seen people complaining how HORRIBLE the &#8220;Burly Battle&#8221; was.

First of all&#8230;y&#8217;all are spoiled. You&#8217;re expecting the Wachowskis to work miracles. Some of the effects in that scene too TWO YEARS to render.

Secondly, I don&#8217;t mind some &#8220;over the top&#8221; effects \*inside\* the Matrix. It&#8217;s not the real world. Neo bends the rules to his whim, and Agents (like Smith) operate at a subset of the rules.

My friend Chris and I have a theory that the whole &#8220;humans as batteries&#8221; thing is a fake, and that the machines need the humans alive because it gives them purpose. This film was a lot about &#8220;purpose&#8221;. You do what you are supposed to do, etc, and the only machines we&#8217;ve seen so far are the ones that are a reaction to the humans &#8211; either they are involved in the Matrix, or they are involved with the policing or harvesting of the humans

Now, granted&#8230;since the movies are human-centric, it would make sense that we would only see the machines that interact with the humans &#8211; but what is the PURPOSE of the machines if there are no humans?

I really, really hope that the &#8220;humans as batteries&#8221; thing is all part of a second Matrix to give the humans in the real Matrix a purpose &#8211; it would be a great &#8220;fuck you&#8221; from the Wachowskis to all the naysayers.
