I am now safely arrived in Minneapolis, at the Emmyzoo.

Got in last night, after a short layover in Chicago. It was kind of surreal to be back &#8220;home&#8221; for only about 20 minutes&#8230;and even stranger to fly over my office and my house. Weird.

Emmy is at work, and I&#8217;m doing some reading. I think I&#8217;m going to go find a Microcenter or other type of place and buy her some more RAM &#8211; this computer is trying, valiently, to run XP with only 128 MB. Ouch.

Oh, and for those of you who missed my &#8220;edit&#8221; yesterday, Colin Horwedel (sideburned son to and Partytom) was born at 11:58 AM.
