The worst part about all of this is figuring out what the impact is for the photos. All of our photos are outside, obviously, and in various locations. When we talked to our photographer the other day, she brought up the possibility of inclement weather, and suggested we discuss backup plans. She suggested if it wasn&#8217;t storming, we could do some of the photos in the rain, if we obtained large golf umbrellas for everyone (18 x $12 = eep!). Also, we came up with an indoor location for the photos &#8211; the Garfield Park Conservatory. This place is really pretty, and has a lot of neat places to photograph inside.

Problem? To shoot wedding photos there, you need a permit from the Chicago Park District. $50/hour. No big deal&#8230;except&#8230;.

&#8230;you have to apply for the permit 14 days in advance.

I don&#8217;t have the slightest idea what we&#8217;re going to do.

**UPDATE:** Just got off the phone with the nice people at the Chicago Park District. We will have our permit by Wednesday. Whew!
