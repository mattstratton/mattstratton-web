Just rolled into the office after flying home

Thanks to for driving my ass in super early this morning.

Also, fyi, I have no access to email during the day at work anymore. So if you have to get a hold of me, either wait until I get home, or send me an email at work. If you don&#8217;t know my work email, then you must not need to reach me that badly, now do you?
