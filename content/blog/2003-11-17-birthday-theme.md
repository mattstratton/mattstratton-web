So my birthday party will be in a couple weeks.

I am going to do like Louis did, and have it in a bar in a private room. But I want a good theme (his was &#8220;7 Sins&#8221;). I wanted to do a Vegas theme, but Illinois is super strict about casino nights; we can&#8217;t do gambling at all, even for fake money.

Also, if the theme could somehow incorporate GOGA*, that would be good too.
