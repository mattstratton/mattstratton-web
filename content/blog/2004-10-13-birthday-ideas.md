So I turn 30 in December.

I kind of want to do something cool to celebrate the occassion. For example, last year for his 30th, my friend Lou threw a great &#8220;7 Sins&#8221; themed party. It was perfect for him.

In a few weeks, Lippy turns 30 and is having a costume party (it&#8217;s right around Halloween). It will be teh awesome.

Anyway, I&#8217;ve been trying to think of a good idea for my birthday. Last year I had a &#8220;Vegas&#8221; themed party that was kind of a bust. I didn&#8217;t have too much fun.

So I need ideas for the birthday action. I&#8217;ve had a couple so far &#8211; here they are:

**Road Trips**
  
Possibly head out of town to someplace cool with good friends. Vegas was suggested, but I&#8217;m not getting a lot of people seeming interested. NYC was also suggested, but the Y6A trip seemed to be the big NYC trip. Another suggestion was New Orleans.

**Party Time**
  
There&#8217;s a cool venue that is actually an old speakeasy that Tracy found. It&#8217;s a neat space, but you can only get it with an open bar package. So if I were to have a party there, there would probably be like a $30 cover, but it would be for open bar. I&#8217;d really like to do something with that space, but can&#8217;t figure out what. There&#8217;s a stage in there, so something with improv could be cool. Backstreet and I thought of having a &#8220;talent show&#8221;, but when I ran that by folks, nobody seemed to think that anyone would participate. I thought it would be cool though &#8211; it could be like American Idol with me being one of the judges. Because for my 30th birthday, I think the most important thing is that all night I want to feel superior to everyone else.

Anyone have ideas?
