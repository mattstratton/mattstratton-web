It&#8217;s **Hopsiah the Kanga-Jew**!

_Hopisiah the Kanga-Jew knows history because his family lived it! Hopsiah lives in the Middle East, where his ancestors and those of all the other animals and humans alive today exited Noah&#8217;s Ark 4,000 years ago. But unlike the other kangaroos who hopped to Australia, Hopsiah&#8217;s family stayed by to witness the coming of the Messiah! Learn more about the kangaroos of the Middle East at [OBJECTIVE: Creation Education: Kangaroos][2]._
