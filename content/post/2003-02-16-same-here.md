So the saga of &#8220;Matt feels disconnected from his friends&#8221; continues.

It&#8217;s weird. I feel like I&#8217;ve been busy lately, but busy by myself, if that makes sense. I see people all the time, but I feel very alone. Work is not helping of course, because I don&#8217;t know anyone there yet, and have basically just been sitting at my desk reading documents. But even out socially&#8230;people who were close friends of mine feel like passing acquaintances lately. I don&#8217;t know why that is. I know part of it is that most of my friends are married, or involved in serious relationships, which of course has made them change. And I moved farther away from one good friend of mine, who used to be my neighbor, practically. And I haven&#8217;t been able to go out as much and have fun over the past few months, because of financial things. So maybe that&#8217;s all part of it.

Or maybe my time with this group of friends is coming to close. Maybe it&#8217;s time to move on. I don&#8217;t want to do that, of course, because I like my friends. But maybe they&#8217;ve grown tired of me. I guess there&#8217;s an expiration date on finding Matt fun and interesting.
