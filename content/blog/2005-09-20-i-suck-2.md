So against everyone&#8217;s advice, I just called Jaymie again.

Although this time, instead of &#8220;wanted to see if you wanted to get together&#8221; it was &#8220;I was thinking of going to Improv Olympic on Friday, wanted to see if you wanted to go too&#8221;. You know, an actual plan.

She&#8217;s clearly screening; it rang a bunch of times before I got the voice mail.

I&#8217;m pathetic. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s been a long time since I thought there was someone with actual potential.

Le sigh.
