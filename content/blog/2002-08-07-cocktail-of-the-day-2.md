Today&#8217;s cocktail was the biggest hit of my &#8220;practice&#8221; party.

Highly recommended for people who like &#8220;yummy&#8221; drinks &#8211; it&#8217;s like a Shirley Temple with claws. Invented at the turn of the 19th century in Singapore&#8217;s Raffles Hotel (which is still there), the recipe has changed somewhat since then.

**Singapore Sling**
  
1 oz. gin
  
1-1/2 oz. Sweet and Sour
  
1/2 oz. Grenadine

Blend in mix cup with ice. Pour into iced Collins glass. Fill with soda and top with 1/2 oz. cherry brandy. Garnish with a cherry or flag.

The easiest way to remember how to make this drink? It&#8217;s a &#8220;Red Tom Collins Sandwich&#8221;.

&#8220;Blend&#8221; means either shake or flash-blend. It does not mean put in an Osterizer blender. A &#8220;flag&#8221; is a cherry and orange slice picked together.
