So lately several people have been bitching at me (or in general) that by using Evite, we&#8217;re exposing their email addresses to spammers.

I call shenanigans on this.

If you look at an evite, the guests invited show up as their evite username (if they&#8217;re evite users) or **just the part of the email address before the &#8220;@&#8221;**.

I looked at the source HTML of an evite, and the only email address that even existed in the source was the email of the host.

I know that a while ago (probably in the last year), this was not the case &#8211; unregistered users DID have their email address show up. But that&#8217;s not true anymore.

I am going to keep using Evite. It works for what I need. But I&#8217;ll stop inviting the folks who bitch about it to my parties, if they&#8217;re erroneously concerned that the main reason they are getting spam is Evite.com. Insecure Windows boxes that let spammers harvest out of their Outlook address books are a much larger concern.

And for the one of you on my friends list who is going to think this is all about you, it&#8217;s not. Just maybe 10% about you. Congrats, you were a straw.
