Are you excited? This is my very first video Tech Tip. It&#8217;s a walk-through on importing photos from your digital camera or memory card into Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2. Let me know what you think of it!



Some notes on the video&#8230;

  * This took at least six &#8220;takes&#8221;. The first version was over 10 minutes long, which is just ridiculous. Lesson learned from that first take? Write down notes, or else you&#8217;ll start rambling. I think there&#8217;s at least 2 minutes in that version of me going on and on about the DNG format.
  * I had quite a few takes that only got about 45 seconds into it, and ended with me saying &#8220;crap!&#8221; (or other words less pleasant).
  * One attempt was interrupted by my wife calling me from downstairs because my son projectiled all over her and the couch.
  * I&#8217;m really kind of annoyed by something I say towards the end of this video, but I was NOT going to start over. And then when I went to edit it, I didn&#8217;t have the energy to cut it out.
