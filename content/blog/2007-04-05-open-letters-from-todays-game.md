Dear Ronnie Cedeno,

In the future, when there are men on second and third, two outs, and Soriano is on deck, please do not swing at crappy 2-0 pitches.

Thank you,
  
Matt

Dear Ryan Theriot,

When there are two outs, and you are on second base with no other runners, if the ball is hit on the ground right to the third basemen, please do not run in his direction.

Thank you,
  
Matt

Dear Lou Pinella,

I&#8217;m sorry.

Matt
