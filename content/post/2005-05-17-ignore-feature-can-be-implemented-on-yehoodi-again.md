For that manner, this will work on pretty much any phpBB-based forum.

<span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight:bold;">IMPORTANT NOTE: This is an UNSUPPORTED hack. I will post instructions here, but I provide NO support on this. </span>Do NOT pm/im/email me asking &#8220;how do I install Greasemonkey?&#8221; or anything like that. This is only to be attempted if you are very comfortable fucking around with Firefox, etc.</p> 

<p>
  That being said&#8230;here&#8217;s how to do it:
</p>

<p>
  First, install the <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Greasemonkey</a> extension into Firefox. Once you have installed it, you need to install this user script (right-click on the link and say &#8220;install user script&#8221;). Once you have done this, refresh Yehoodi. Next to user&#8217;s names by their posts, you will see a little &#8220;x&#8221;. Click it to ignore them.
</p>

<p>
  Again, for some reason, the quoted parts of their posts will not be ignored, but the rest will. Good luck. </span>
