So as you may recall&#8230;my friend Jason and I put together a DVD of old footage for our friends for a holiday gift.

Well, Jason gave the DVD&#8217;s to a lot of the recipients when they were visiting him, his wife, and their newborn daughter. He told me that everyone really loved it, and that they were impressed with how extensive it was. He told them &#8220;Matt really deserves a lot of the credit for this, he did most of the work,&#8221; and suggested that they email or call me to thank me.

None of them have. It has been at least two weeks.
