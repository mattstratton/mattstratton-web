I passed my last Microsoft exam today. So now I have the following certs:
  
MCP &#8211; Microsoft Certified Professional (since 1998!)
  
MCSE (NT 4) &#8211; Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer
  
MCSA (Server 2000) &#8211; Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator
  
MCTS (Active Directory 2008) &#8211; Microsoft Certified Technical Specialist
  
MCTS (Network Infrastructure 2008) &#8211; Microsoft Certified Technical Specialist)
  
MCITP (Server 2008) &#8211; Microsoft Certified IT Pro

Quite the alphabet soup. Incidentally, I have a Cisco certification too, but I think it has expired since I got it ten years ago :)
