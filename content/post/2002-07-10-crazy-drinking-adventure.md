So tonight was a pretty goofy night&#8230;

I got home from practicing with Tracy around 8:30. About an hour later, my phone rang &#8211; it was my roommate.

&#8220;Where are you?&#8221; she asked.

&#8220;I&#8217;m at home,&#8221; I said.

&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m out on the sunporch. I&#8217;m stealing one of your cigarettes.&#8221;

So I went out back with her&#8230;we went up on the roof, smoked, and had a drink. She didn&#8217;t have to work in the morning, so we decided to go to a bar. Nobody else in our neighborhood that we knew was home&#8230;on a whim, I decided to call my friend Jon, who lives down the street. Last I heard, Jon was on a project in Alabama, but I figured it was worth a shot. He was actually home&#8230;and quite willing to join us.

The three of us headed to Jake&#8217;s Pub, where we drank a couple cans of Schlitz &#8211; because, as you know, when you&#8217;re out of Schlitz, you&#8217;re out of beer. Since none of us had to get up in the morning, we elected to continue our night at The Note. I called my friends Evin and Noah (who _love_ The Note), and it didn&#8217;t take much arm-twisting to convince them to meet us there. They were out with Jason, so all six of us hung out until 2:30 in the morning drinking and playing pool.

Good times.
