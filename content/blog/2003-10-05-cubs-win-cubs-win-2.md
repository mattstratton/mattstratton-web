<big>Cubs win! Cubs win!</big>

Before the game, I gave the Cubs a 60% chance of winning it.

By the end of the 1st inning, I knew they had this game wrapped up.

Problem is in the future. You can&#8217;t win a best of seven series with a two-man rotation. Zambrano and Clement are gonna have to step it up.
