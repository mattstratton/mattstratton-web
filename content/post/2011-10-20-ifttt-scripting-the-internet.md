    I'm pretty much in love with the service known as ifttt - "if this, then that". It's kind of like a scripting language for the Internet.

I&#8217;m pretty much in love with the service known as <a href="http://ifttt.com" target="_blank">ifttt</a> &#8211; &#8220;if this, then that&#8221;. It&#8217;s kind of like a scripting language for the Internet.

For example, if all goes according to plan, just by virtue of creating a new post in WordPress, the link will be auto-shared to my Facebook fan page.

I&#8217;ve also started experimenting with having YouTube video uploads automatically create WordPress posts (for use on MSTHK). Lots of potential here. After I&#8217;ve gotten a bit smarter with it, I&#8217;ll definitely be posting more about this super cool service.
