One week from tomorrow. Crazy.

Our house is officially turned into Wedding Project Central. We try to keep the clutter at bay, but the whole apartment is virtually overflowing with bags of candy, jars, framed photos, programs, bags, and all sorts of other things.

Made some good progress this week though. The candy buffet is almost completed &#8211; we just need to get a couple more jars. But Carrie made all the cool signs/labels for each candy, and they look great. I wanted to take a picture of a big pile of Rollos for Brian, but I forgot. He&#8217;ll have to visit them at the reception.

We still have to tie ribbon on about 75% of the programs, although I think my mom and sister might be coming over tomorrow night to help with that. But most of the projects are done. The big step now is packing everything up to take to the hotel, and labeling it all in such a way that the hotel people can figure out what is for which table, etc. 

Still have to fill out the seating chart for the rehearsal dinner, and also the form for the tables for the reception (we know who is sitting at which table, but have to figure out which table goes where, if that makes sense). Tuesday I call the hotel to give them our final numbers and we sign all the paperwork for the final payments. Whoa.

Really enjoyed the season finale of _The Office_ last night. And the series finale of _Gilmore Girls_ this week was actually really good &#8211; it&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;ve been disappointed by GG for the past season or two, but &#8220;Bon Voyage&#8221; was pretty darn good.
