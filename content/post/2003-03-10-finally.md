On my desk right now are two wonderful, wonderful things.

They are two Digi-Beta cassettes&#8230;one copy each of the [_Dancing With Gaia_][1] digital master.

The film is done.

It&#8217;s not a great film. I&#8217;m not even sure if right now I consider it a good film. But it&#8217;s a done film.

A friend of mine watched it tonight &#8211; and he had some really insightful comments on his interpretation of what the film was about. It was really great to hear; I&#8217;ve been so hung up on the technical side of this movie, worrying about whether people will think it &#8220;looks&#8221; good&#8230;that I haven&#8217;t thought as much about what the movie is saying.

In his mind, it&#8217;s clearly saying something. Something important either. That makes me happy.

Any way you slice it, I&#8217;ve got the film finished. It&#8217;s been a long road, but this part is now done.
