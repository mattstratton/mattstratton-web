So back in December, I signed up for Quicken&#8217;s Billpay service, so that I could pay bills directly from Quicken on my Mac.

Well, it never quite worked. I never paid a single bill using their service, but continued to pay $9.95 a month, despite the fact that it didn&#8217;t work.

Last month, I decided I had enough. On May 8th, I saw the charge on my bank account for $9.95 to Quicken Billpay. I immediately called them up, and said I wanted to cancel my account. I was assured that the account was cancelled, and that was that.

Well, I just looked at my bank statement. On June 8th, I was again charged by Quicken Billpay. When I called, I was told &#8220;oh, you cancelled in the middle of a billing cycle, so you were charged for the month of May&#8221;. I said I thought that wasn&#8217;t fair, and she said she would have a manager &#8220;review&#8221; it, since she didn&#8217;t have the authorization to refund any money.

This &#8220;review&#8221; would take 5-10 business days. I explained that I felt that was unacceptable, and requested that I speak to a manager immediately. She said she would see if &#8220;any were available&#8221;. After sitting on hold for five minutes, she explained that all of the supervisors were &#8220;on calls&#8221;, but she would put in a &#8220;manager callback&#8221; and someone would call me back within two hours.

I took a trick from Partytom and told her no, I was a customer who felt that he was fraudulently charged, and would wait on hold for her manager. Five minutes later, the manager answered, and he quickly told me that he would refund my the $9.95.

And that a refund took 7-12 days to process.

Seriously, you know what bugs me? Every single company on the planet can CHARGE you in a matter of seconds. But for some reason, there is no immediate refund system.

So this is my mission &#8211; to tell everyone what terrible customer service Quicken Billpay has. And encourage you all to not use if, it you were considering it. Chances are your bank offers billpay services&#8230;FOR FREE, that actually work just as well, if not better, than Quicken&#8217;s piece of crap.
