For those of you who work in the Loop&#8230;I cannot recomend enough, for lunch, [Chicken Planet][1]

It is, seriously, the best chicken you ever had. And cheap as hell. The place looks like it might be sketchy (from the outside) but it&#8217;s quite clean inside and the food is great.

BEST CHICKEN IN THE WORLD.
