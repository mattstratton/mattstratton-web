OK, so last night I was watching _While You Were Out_ with Sarah. The guy&#8217;s wife was a total princess type&#8230;and they started getting paranoid that she was going to get home before they were done.

So I said to Sarah&#8230;
  
&#8220;See, I don&#8217;t think you understand the seriousness of this Susanna situation. She comes home, and finds a bunch of designers doing a bunch of designer shit, what you think is gonna happen?&#8221;

&#8220;She&#8217;s gonna freak&#8221;

&#8220;No shit she&#8217;s gonna freak!&#8221;

&#8220;Well you ain&#8217;t got no problems, Teresa. You go back in there and chill them designers out. And wait for Amy Wynn, who will be arriving directly.&#8221;

&#8220;Amy Wynn? You sending Amy Wynn? Shit, that&#8217;s all you needed to say!&#8221;
