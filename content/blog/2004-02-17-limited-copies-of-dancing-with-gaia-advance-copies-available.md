The &#8220;official&#8221; release of _<a href="https://dancingwithgaia.com/" target="_blank">Dancing With Gaia</a>_ will be March 17, but I have a limited number of the &#8220;advance&#8221; copies of the DVD still available.

If you want to purchase one now, instead of waiting another month, visit our <a href="https://dancingwithgaia.com/purchase.htm" target="_blank">purchase page</a>. You have to send in your PayPal order by noon on Friday, Feb 20, or else I won&#8217;t be able to ship it to you until March 1 (because I&#8217;ll be on vacation).

This is a special advance offer only for our friends, so don&#8217;t bandy that URL about. The regular Joe has to wait until next month.
