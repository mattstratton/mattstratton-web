So as you [may recall][1], I went out with [Ferret Girl][2] last weekend.

And things went really well.

So I invited her to come to the Cubs game with me next weekend, but it turns out I screwed up the date of the game&#8230;and she can&#8217;t go on the day that I have tickets. But on the advice of , I bucked up and just asked her when I could see her again. And she said we should go out next Saturday (we&#8217;re both booked this weekend).

She&#8217;s remained flirty on IM which is good. Man, I hope I don&#8217;t screw this one up. I really do like her. A lot. Yargh.
