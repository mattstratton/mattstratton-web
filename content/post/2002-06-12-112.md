So today is the first day of Mugsy&#8217;s Workout Extravaganza.

I&#8217;m sick of being a fatass. It ends here. I&#8217;m trusting y&#8217;all to keep me honest.

Bowling league last night. Wow, I swear, there&#8217;s nothing like bowling in a league to make yourself feel classy&#8230;or the opposite.

I got another external Firewire hard drive for my video editing station today&#8230;so now I have 180 GB for video capture, which is about the right size for all the DWG footage. Now I just have to log all those clips so I can start rough-cutting. Only downside is this new drive is LOUD&#8230;it&#8217;s annoying. The 60 GB external isn&#8217;t noisy like this. Oh well. Whaddya gonna do, right?
