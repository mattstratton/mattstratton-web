I&#8217;m quite excited. Not only is there [new Filmtease goodness][1] today, but I&#8217;m actually a part of the goodness. The frosting on top of the Zinger, if you will&#8230;or perhaps the white doodles on the Hostess cupcake.

Anyway, check it out. I helped review the trailers for 21 Grams, The Singing Detective, and The Matrix Revolutions.

[Filmtease.com][2] is a whiz bang awesome website that is the brainchild of because he&#8217;s freakin&#8217; brilliant. Oh, and Steve and Brian too.
