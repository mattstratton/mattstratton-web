So now that I have a camera on my phone, I decided it was time to join the ranks of Cat Schwartz and and create a <a href="https://www.textamerica.com" target="_blank">moblog</a>.

Anyway, you can check it out at <a href="https://mugsypix.textamerica.com" target="_blank"><strong>mugsypix.textamerica.com</strong></a>. Nothing much there yet, but it should eventually be fun, and maybe provide a purpose for this camera phone thingy.
