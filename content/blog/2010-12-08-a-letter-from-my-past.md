Basically, it allows you to schedule emails to be sent to yourself at a future date. Trapper used this service to send himself emails on his birthday every year, which I thought was a pretty cool idea&#8230;so I started doing it myself.

Yesterday, I received the letter I sent to myself one year ago on my 35th birthday. Here it is:

> **Happy birthday, FutureMatt!** 
> 
> Dear Future Matt,
> 
> Happy 36th birthday. I&#8217;m writing this to you on your 35th birthday. Carrie is getting ready in the other room, and we are going to go get her drivers license updated and a new Chase card.
> 
> Do you remember what it was like when Carrie was super-pregnant? It&#8217;s crazy to think that in your time, she is back to non-pregnant mode. Remember having to sleep in separate beds? Yeah, that sucks. You&#8217;re lucky you don&#8217;t have that anymore.
> 
> How are Henry and Joey? They are almost a year old for you, but I haven&#8217;t even met them yet. That&#8217;s totally weird.
> 
> How&#8217;s work going? Did Redesign 5 go okay? Did we pick Bing or Google Maps? Is FAST super awesome?
> 
> Did Becky and Eric get engaged? What about Meggie and Bryce?
> 
> Have a great birthday, Mr. 36-year-old-dude!
> 
> _written Dec 7th, 2009, sent 1 year into the future, to Dec 7th, 2010_

Nothing really that hilarious or insightful&#8230;although to update you, we are still in beta on Redesign 5 (we did pick Bing Maps, and FAST is pretty cool), and Becky and Eric did get engaged.

I just composed my future birthday email today&#8230;so come back in a year to see what it said&#8230;assuming I remember to post it.
