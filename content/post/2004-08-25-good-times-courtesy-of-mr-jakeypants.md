I was just kind of wondering&#8230;if it would be possible to make a robot
  
designed like a weeble, so you cant knock it over&#8230;this would be
  
usefull in rough terrain, so if the robot falls&#8230;it Pops back up, just
  
like the best invention ever, The weeble.

Just a thought

-Mike Cadger

remember &#8220;weebles wobble, but the DON&#8217;T fall down!&#8221;
