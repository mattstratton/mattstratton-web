Did some post-production work this weekend. On Saturday, Andrew and I worked for six hours to cut together three minutes of footage. At this rate, it will take us about 140 hours to cut the film. I think this is not a good benchmark, though.

I&#8217;m really happy with what we got done though. Andrew&#8217;s a pretty good hand at this stuff. And I&#8217;m glad \*he\* is doing it, and not me. Many times in the editing room, I sat there thinking &#8220;I&#8217;m not doing ANYTHING here&#8230;shouldn&#8217;t I be doing more work?&#8221; and then I realized, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s what HE is here for. My job is to stay out of his way and tell him what I want.&#8221; One of the things about being a director I&#8217;m still getting used to; realizing that I am \*supposed\* to tell people what to do. It&#8217;s my job.
