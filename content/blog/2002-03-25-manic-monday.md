Interesting weekend.

Friday night, got stood up (as discussed earlier). Ended up going to HOL to get mah boom tss on, yo&#8230;finished the night with Backstreet at the Golden Apple. We talked about improv and the Harold. Got home around 4 am. That was a problem.

Saturday afternoon went location scouting with Ben and Nicolle. Traffic was HORRIBLE. But I think we accomplished a lot.

Saturday night was Janeane Garafalo at the Cadillac Palace. I went with Joann and Kitty. While we were waiting to get in, some girl approached Kitty and me. Apparently she had overheard us talking about improv. She asked &#8220;are you guys actors or something?&#8221;

So lovely Kitty, my good friend that she is, managed to deflect all attention to me, by saying &#8220;I&#8217;m an actor that is in a film HE is directing.&#8221;

Now we have this girl (who is DESPARATELY looking for a job) attached to me. At one point she asks use how old we are&#8230;Kitty says &#8220;25&#8221; and the girl says something like &#8220;Wow! You guys don&#8217;t look THAT old!&#8221;

Then I say &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m 27.&#8221; It was worth it just for the look on her face.

Garafalo was hella funny. She so sardonic. I love that.

Yesterday I workshopped with some of my supporting actors. Everyone was so good&#8230;it was really quick. I worked a little bit with my principals (they were there for dance workshopping) and saw some of the &#8220;peformance&#8221; piece.

You know, I always wondered what a swing routine choreographed by a neo-hippie modern dance instructor would look like&#8230;

&#8230;and now I know.

Went bowling last night and then watched The Big Lebowski. DT now owes me TWO dinners.

I rule.
