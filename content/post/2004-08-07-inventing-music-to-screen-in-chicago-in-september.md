My short film (INVENTING: MUSIC) has been selected to screen at the <a href="https://www.projectchicago.com/" target="_blank">Chicago International REEL Shorts Festival</a> the weekend of Sept 17-19.

It will take place at the 3 Penny Cinema in Lincoln Park. I don&#8217;t know the date and time of our screening, but I&#8217;ll keep you all posted. I hope you can make it, if you&#8217;re in Chicago.

Congrats to the cast and crew on a job well done! This is the third festival the movie has been accepted to, and the first one in Chicago.
