I am really, REALLY tired of being sick.

It&#8217;s just so damn annoying. I have way too much work to do, but I can barely get out of bed, much less shower, get on the train, go to the office, etc.

I tried this morning, I really did. But I almost passed out in the shower. HOW ANNOYING. For serious. I hate being out of control of my body. Probably one of the reasons I don&#8217;t like drugs much. Anyway.

Going to keep eating soup, taking vitamin C, and taking my tylenol flu. I just hope this isn&#8217;t developing into bronchitis or something like that. Blech.
