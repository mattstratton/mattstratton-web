&#8230;Punches and I are done with Windyhop.

I finally got the straw that broke this camel&#8217;s back. I&#8217;ve had too much whining from the users, combined with the fact that neither of us are really in touch with that community anymore anyway. It&#8217;s time to pass the torch to people who are still excited about that stuff.

I put up a post soliciting folks to take over. We&#8217;ll see. If nobody does, well, I guess Windyhop will just end up with a whimper over the next year or so. I sure hope that there are people who will do it though. Punches and I have spent the last five years creating/building/supporting that site. I don&#8217;t want to let it go, but we have to.
