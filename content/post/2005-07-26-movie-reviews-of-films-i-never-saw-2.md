I am pulling my contributions from an old Yehoodi thread, but I just am so tickled with these, I had to share them with you all. The gag is to write a full review of a movie you have no need to see, based solely on what you can determine from the trailers.

<span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Whole Ten Yards</span> </span>

Long before DeNiro showed us that tough guys could be funny in <span style="font-style:italic;">Analyze This</span>, Bruce Willis was goonishly mugging his way through &#8220;Moonlighting&#8221;. But despite this glorious pedigree, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Whole Ten Yards</span> is brought down by the inclusion of the always unfunny Amanda Peet, who fails to bring even the modicum of comedic timing she displayed in such masterpieces as <span style="font-style:italic;">Body Shots</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Saving Silverman</span>. Matthew Perry phones in the same character he&#8217;s been playing since <span style="font-style:italic;">Fools Rush In</span>, complete with second season <span style="font-style:italic;">Friends</span>-era mugging. However, nothing less is expected from the director who brought us other unrequested sequels such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Grumpier Old Men</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Odd Couple 2</span>. One wonders what happened to the Howard Deutch who brought us <span style="font-style:italic;">Pretty In Pink</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Some Kind of Wonderful</span>.

This reviewer thinks it was a little program called &#8220;Melrose Place&#8221;.

<span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Wedding Date</span></p> 

<p>
  It&#8217;s a shame to see Debra Messing lower herself to a forumlaic movie like this, abandoning the artistic integrity she displayed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Garfield</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Along Came Polly</span>, but a girl&#8217;s gotta eat, I suppose. Dermot Mulroney somehow manages to convince us all that he can play more than just smarmy&#8230;he can play smarmy with *heart*.

<span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kangaroo Jack</span></p> 

<p>
  There&#8217;s a special place in Hell for Jerry Bruckheimer. After he brought us <span style="font-style:italic;">Coyote Ugly</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rock</span>, it was an easy path down that slippery slope that lands at <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanagroo Jack</span>.
</p>

<p>
  In this comedy (and I use the term loosely), two friends (played by Jerry O&#8217;Connel of <span style="font-style:italic;">Tomcats</span> fame and <span style="font-style:italic;">Barbershop</span>&#8216;s Anthony Anderson, who after <span style="font-style:italic;">Big Momma&#8217;s House</span> really should know better) get caught up in a dangerous web of organized crime, and (naturally) become &#8220;carriers&#8221; for $10,000 of Mob money. Like so many mobster initiates, they fall victim to a devious kangaroo, who bounces off with the 10 large, necessitating a long, elaborate, and infrequently amusing chase through the Australian outback.
</p>

<p>
  O&#8217;Connell demonstrates the hackish comedic indignation he perfected in in such gems as <span style="font-style:italic;">Body Shots</span>, which provides the perfect foil to Anderson&#8217;s over-the-top mugging. This one-joke pony never gets hopping, and rest assured, all the funny bits were in the trailer. Which was not funny at all.
