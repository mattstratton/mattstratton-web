Since everyone else is doing it&#8230;

It was a real horpy tor&#8230;Sarah made a great turkey, and I made my grandma&#8217;s potato salad. We had seven people over for dinner; Sarah, Chris, and myself, Mike and Dana, Erika, and Curtis (a good friend of Sarah&#8217;s, and the guy who did my most recent ink).

The food was damn good.

Then other friends showed up for dessert and movies. We watched The Osbournes, _Shrek_, and _Frezno Smooth_.

All in all, a good turkey day.
