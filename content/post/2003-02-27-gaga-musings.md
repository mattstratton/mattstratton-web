Just to bring you all up to speed&#8230;

Was on the phone for a long time with Gaga Girl #1 this weekend. Caught up on things, chatted, gossiped&#8230;it was fun. She&#8217;s been extra-flirty online lately, which is, of course, messing with my head.

Talked to Gaga Girl #2 the other night about things and her Gaga Boy&#8230;somehow the subject came up and I told her that I&#8217;d been thinking of asking her out, before she got all gaga over the fella. She seemed to think that was a shame that the timing was off. And then she told me that she wasn&#8217;t seriously involved. Or maybe she told me that earlier. I don&#8217;t really remember.

Anyway, Mugsy&#8217;s head is all messed with these days. But at least I can get online at work now.
