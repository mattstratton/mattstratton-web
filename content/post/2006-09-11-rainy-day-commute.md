Wasn&#8217;t sure if I wanted to ride in this morning. Looked at the weather last night, and told Carrie &#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to skip riding tomorrow, since Monday is the only day that is supposed to rain this week&#8221;.

Woke up, saw that it wasn&#8217;t raining. Looked like it was going to be clear for the next hour or so, and decided to go for it (taking a cue from a post I&#8217;d seen on [BikeForums.net][1] about rarely regretting to ride, but often regretting to not).

No rain the whole way in &#8211; it was a little chilly, but about halfway in, I didn&#8217;t care anymore, because the @#%#$ windbreaker I bought at Target yesterday doesn&#8217;t breathe for CRAP. The parts of my body covered by the dryfit t-shirt underneath weren&#8217;t too bad, but my lower arms were DRIPPING by the time I rolled into work. My back was a little sweaty too.

Oh, and I discovered that yet another thing interferes with my crappy wireless bike computer&#8230;my front headlight. Luckily it was pretty light out by the time I got going, so I was okay. But it&#8217;s time to replace that computer!

Speaking of which&#8230;I know some of you all are cyclists, so maybe you might have some insight into this.

A few months ago, I bought a <a href="http://www.pricepoint.com/detail/14353-095_SETQV5-0-Search--/Sette-Quantum-X2-v.2.0-Wireless-Computer.htm" target="_blank" class="postlink">Sette Quantum X2 v.2.0 Wireless Computer</a> from Pricepoint. It seemed pretty cool, until lately I noticed it was WILDLY inaccurate. Well, I figured out that the &#8220;inaccuracy&#8221; was coming from the fact that I would bring the computer inside after riding (in order to record the information), and it was picking up signals from my laptop or cell phone, and thinking that I was speeding along at 35 mph while I was sitting at my desk.

So I decided to not bring it in anymore. Well, I then found out that if I carry my cell phone in my pocket while riding, it fucks up the reading. So the cell phone went back into the bag.

This morning, it was a little dim when I headed out to work. So I fired up my front headlight for the first time. About a mile into the commute, I noticed that my computer was reading 0 mph. Then it would go to 7. Then back to 0.

I thought maybe it was something to do with the dampness (it rained this morning), but I&#8217;ve ridden in the rain before and it worked. On a lark, I turned off the headlight.

Guess what? The computer worked again. MotherTRUCKER!

Therefore, I&#8217;m in the market for a new bike computer. I think I want to avoid wireless this time, since I don&#8217;t ride off-road and don&#8217;t mind a cable. My ideal bike computer would have programmable odometer, HRM, and be able to be detached from the bike easily and brought inside (for recording purposes). That last part, I don&#8217;t know if there are any &#8220;wired&#8221; computers that do that, so I think I could skip it.

Any recommendations?
