<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290249/" target="_blank">New Suit</a>
  
Directed by Fran&#231;ois Velle
  
Written by Craig Sherman
  
Starring Jordan Bridges, Marisa Coughlan, Heather Donahue, and Dan Hedaya

I liked this movie a lot more the first time I saw it, when it was called _The Big Picture_. Or maybe it was _Swimming With Sharks_. Either way, this was a fun film that had some comedic moments, but like most movies about making movies, it lacked in characterization. _State and Main_ is one of the few films about filmmaking that works, and it works because it&#8217;s not _about_ filmmaking; it&#8217;s about people. And the people just happen to be making a movie.
