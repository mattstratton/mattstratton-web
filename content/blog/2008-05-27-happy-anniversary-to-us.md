Yesterday was our first wedding anniversary. Everything turned out pretty much super awesome, although it was a bit of a hectic (but fun) weekend.

Saturday morning, I woke up super early and headed out to Hillside to play nine holes with a couple co-workers. Considering I haven&#8217;t picked up a golf club (other than at the Bunny Hutch) in about 15 years, I didn&#8217;t embarrass myself TOO badly. It was a good time, and I&#8217;d really like to play some more this summer.

Saturday night Carrie and I rented _Juno_ from On Demand. I barely made it through (because I was tired, not any reflection upon the film). I definitely feel that it did not live up to the hype, but it was a sweet little movie and very funny. I think that Diablo Cody definitely bit off more characters than she could handle, and a lot got lost. But overall, I would give it three stars.

Sunday morning, we woke up super early to do Bike the Drive. Afterward, we came home, got cleaned up, and went to church. After a brief disco nap, we headed out to the burbs for my sister&#8217;s graduation party, which was a lot of fun. 

Monday was our actual anniversary. We slept in (yay!) and then went out for lunch on Southport. Spent the afternoon at the Lincoln Park Zoo and then went to check into the Knickerbocker hotel for the night. We got all fancy-pants dressed up, and had a cocktail at the Signature Lounge. Dinner was at NoMI, which was so very good, although also so very expensive. We exchanged gifts (Carrie got me a Speedlite and I got her diamond earrings) and capped off the evening with a carriage ride.

This morning we had breakfast at Meli and then headed to work. All in all, a great weekend, and I couldn&#8217;t ask for a better way to celebrate our one year mark.
