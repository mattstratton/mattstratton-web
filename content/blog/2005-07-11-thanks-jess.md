Just a shout-out to , who a while ago clued me in to Damn Small Linux as a CD-bootable distro that handled wifi easily. My neighbor&#8217;s ancient machine (200 mhz Pentium II running Win98) is completely spyware-ridden, so I gave him a DSL boot CD. Got him up on the network, and he&#8217;s happily using Firefox under Linux now. After he confirms (tonight) that he can do all the web browsing he&#8217;s used to, I will go over there and install the distro on the hard drive (since he&#8217;s not technical enough to be able to configure the wifi card every time he boots).

Yay Jess!
