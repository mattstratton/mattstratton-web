From <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=3375" target="_blank">The Field Guide to North American Hipsters, Vol. I</a>

> To refer to emo as an entire subculture centered on being vain, melodramatic, pathetic, self-absorbed, and emotionally histrionic would be unfair. There’s more to it than that. There’s also all the terrible music, stupid haircuts, and fantastically complex MySpace profiles.

As usual, Something Awful is funnier than your sister.
