So since I&#8217;m planning to buy a shiny new G5 shortly, I decided to sell off my old 12&#8243; G4 Powerbook on ebay.

I put it up last night, and set what I considered to be a fairly high &#8220;Buy It Now&#8221; price.

Well, about an hour ago (12 hours into the auction) someone purchased it for the &#8220;Buy It Now&#8221; price. Sweet!

I should probably have set a higher price then :)
