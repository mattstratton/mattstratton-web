So I just saw the schedule for the Rochester festival&#8230;they put us in kind of a weird slot on Saturday night. Check out what the Gravy Train sandwich is:

_Day of Independence by Chris Tashima, Los Angeles, CA (27 min, 35mm, color)
  
The story of a young Japanese American and his family, torn apart by unjust incarceration in a U.S. internment camp during World War II.</p> 

Inventing: Music by Matt Stratton & Dallas Trinkle, Chicago, IL (10 min, BetaSP, color)
  
Bill Henderson is an outlaw: riding his Hog, playing his music, and living his dreams on the edge of society.

Prayers from Kawthoolei by Joe Hill White, Los Angeles, CA (30 min, BetaSP, color)
  
A documentary about three friends from the Karen ethnic group of Burma. Two emigrated to Canada; we follow one back to Burma to find the third, left behind years earlier.</em>

There are a couple other shorts that night that look like they might be light-hearted, but I think we&#8217;re the only full-on comedy. Or as Dallas said, maybe they think IM is a documentary. :)
