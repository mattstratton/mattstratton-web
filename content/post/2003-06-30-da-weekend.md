**Friday**
  
Went to a birthday party for the lovely [Kitty][1]. The boys from Injection Records were spinning at [the Jefferson Tap][2]. It was fun, but really long. I got a cool IR t-shirt though. has pictures up on his [website][3] under &#8220;DJ Adventures &#8211; Jefferson Tap&#8221;. Check &#8217;em out. No, seriously. Check &#8217;em out. From now on I am calling Trapper &#8220;Cross-Hand Action&#8221;.

Ended the night at the Golden Apple and got home around 5:30 AM. Eep. Especially considering I started at Tracy&#8217;s house at 8 PM. Double eep moo latte.

**Saturday**
  
Had dinner with [CTodd][4] at Erwin, which was tasty stuff. Then we went to see [The Neutrino Project][5] again. Well, again for me, first time for CTodd. And once again, I laughed. I cried. Etc.

After Neutrino, headed to Studio X, where I met up with Jayno and Erika and we went back to our place (yay air conditioning), drank some beers, ate some pizza, watched _Coupling_ and _The Animatrix_.Good times.

**Sunday**
  
Lazy Sunday. I sat around and got caught up on my Tivo all day. Finally saw _The Office,_ which was pretty funny, but not as good as _Coupling._ Ate Chinese and watched _Sex and the City_, which was funny, because it was about using Tivo to record shows on [BBCA][6]. The ironing was delicious.
