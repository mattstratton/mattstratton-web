&#8230;with Windyhop.

I am sick of the snide comments from fuckhead users who whine and bitch about problems that are apparently &#8220;widespread&#8221;, yet I cannot replicate, so cannot &#8220;fix&#8221;.

I am sick of people using a website that I have spent thousands of hours and a ton of my own money on, but feeling like they have the right to tell me how to do things and that I am doing a shitty job.

I&#8217;m ready to pull the fucking plug on it. The Chicago swing scene can figure their own shit out.
