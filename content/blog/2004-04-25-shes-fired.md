Ferret Girl is fired.

I had asked her out for the Cubs game this weekend. Well, as it happens, I screwed up and got tickets for Saturday, instead of Sunday, which is the day she&#8217;d said she could go.

So I informed her of that, and suggested we go out Saturday night. She agreed and seemed excited at the prospect.

A few days later, I was talking to her and suggested we go to the Clipper on said Saturday. She told me that she&#8217;d have to &#8220;get back to me&#8221; because she might not be able to make it that night after all. This was on Tuesday.

I haven&#8217;t heard from her since then.

I called her last evening to say hello, and see if she was free for tonight. Left a message and have gotten no call back.

The end. She&#8217;s fired. And I bet I never see my Ben Stiller DVD&#8217;s again.
