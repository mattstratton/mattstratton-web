(x-posted, sorta, from [Yehoodi][1])

So, Carrie and I are working out our honeymoon. And in the process of doing so, discovering that it can be a huge pain in the ass.

See, the thing is, I know nothing about this kind of thing. I&#8217;ve never done a big vacation before. And I figure our friends are nothing if not opinionated.

So I ask you, dear readers &#8211; what are your suggestions? To put some parameters in place &#8211; this will be about 7 nights, in late May/early June. We&#8217;d prefer to do all-inclusive (just for convenience), but there needs to be things to do other than just get drunk all the time. We want to go someplace with good beaches, and mostly, interesting activities to pursue. I&#8217;d like to keep the total cost under $4,000 (for two people). Some other caveats &#8211; we&#8217;re avoiding Europe (because we&#8217;ll be doing a big Europe trip in the summer of 2008), and want to have no longer than a 6 hour direct flight. And Carrie isn&#8217;t a big fan of Mexico due to some previous experience.

Thoughts? Suggestions? Tips and tricks?
