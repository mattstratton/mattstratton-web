So tomorrow night I am coaching Jo&#8217;s improv troupe.

I really don&#8217;t know why she asked me to do it. I&#8217;m not some superstar instructor. Hell, I&#8217;m not an instructor at all.

Anyway, I think I&#8217;ve got a decent handle on what we&#8217;re going to do. I want to really work hard on &#8220;live truthfully in an imaginary world&#8221;, with a heavy emphasis on &#8220;imaginary&#8221;. A lot of improvisers are really afraid of going ridiculous &#8211; our comfort zone is in reality. But creating an absurd situation and playing it STRAIGHT ON can be fantastic.

I just am trying to remember some good exercises to help with this. Nando &#8211; you got any ideas?
