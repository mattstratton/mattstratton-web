Just got home from our Texas Hold &#8216;Em Tournament.

I was, as my friend Jeff said, the winningest of the losers. Of course, he was the losingest of the winners. I&#8217;ll explain more later when I detail the game.

But suffice it to say that I won back my $50 entrance fee, and then made a $15 profit on a later side game. But the overall tournament did not end up the way I had predicted (in terms of winners and such). I basically ended up coming in 8th out of 13 players. Kim placed 4th.

However, we had super awesome dealers, including Erika.
