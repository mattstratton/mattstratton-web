I&#8217;m going to head back to bed in a minute, but one of my favorite things about last night:

After the party, Brian, Tracy, Jamie, and I went to the Golden Apple for some food. First of all, it was amusing because we looked funny &#8211; Brian and I matched, and so did Tracy (Julie) and Jamie (Vicky). But as we were walking out of the diner, we went past this drunken girl in a booth who saw us and said &#8220;Oh my god&#8230;it&#8217;s the Love Boat.&#8221; She then smacked her friend in the back of the head and said &#8220;Look! It&#8217;s the fucking LOVE BOAT! That chick is&#8230;what&#8217;s her name&#8230;Wendy!&#8221;

The Fucking Love Boat. That&#8217;s us, motherfucker.
