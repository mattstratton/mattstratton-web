Tonight asked what the whole &#8220;teh&#8221; thing was about.

For those of you who are wondering&#8230;here is the answer, courtesy of [Wiki][1].

_Teh is a common typo for the. This misspelling of the most common word in the English language is so common that it is one of the words in the auto-correct lists of spell-checkers in popular word processing applications, such as Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect.</p> 

In the online slang known as leet, it is deliberately used in place of the word the. Here it is often spelt with a numeral 3 in place of the E, when simple &#8220;th3&#8221; is not used. For example, TEH or T3H are the traditional spellings of &#8220;the&#8221; when part of the phrase &#8220;PH33R T3H \____&#8221;. This is also used by many non-l33t Internet users or in a few Flash videos.

Teh can also be used as an intensifier, as in &#8220;he is teh lame&#8221;.

The intentional use of teh is especially characteristic of the writings of Jeff K., who likely popularized it. A common Jeff K.-esque usage of the word is teh in conjunction with a (misspelled) adjective to create a noun. For example, &#8220;TEH FUNNAY&#8221; refers to a thing that is funny or the general quality of funniness. This usage is commonly in all-caps (again in imitation of Jeff K.) but does not have to be.</i>
