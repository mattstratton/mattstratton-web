So finally&#8230;I got a job.

I&#8217;m not going to name the company (given that people are getting into weird trouble for talking about work on LJ and stuff), but it starts with an &#8220;A&#8221;.

I&#8217;ll be doing server design for the applications teams out there. Downside is that it&#8217;s in the suburbs, so I&#8217;ll be driving to work. But it&#8217;s not a bad drive, and I hear that the company&#8217;s campus is pretty cool.

\*whew\*

I am so relieved.
