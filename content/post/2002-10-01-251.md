OK, so there was a totally [Homestar Runner][1] moment last night.

After closing The Note, Lippy and I were standing around waiting for Chris to drive our sorry asses home, but he was sitting in his car playing some Waits for Evin. So Lippy and I were just standing on the sidewalk, talking about Homestar. Suddenly, this TOTALLY plastered guy just walks up to us. Here&#8217;s how the conversation goes:

Drunk: Who are these guys?
  
Lippy: We&#8217;re just the super cool guys hanging out by this meter. But you have to put a quarter in to hang out. But only between nine and six.
  
Drunk: Ahhhh&#8230;I took my pants off in the bar earlier. I just got up on the pool table and dropped my drawers.
  
Lippy: I try to avoid taking my pants off unless there are chicks around.
  
Drunk: Well, there was one there. I was pretty impressed.
  
Lippy. There may only be one of her, but there is always two of you.
  
Drunk: Yeah. Flash Taco. (and he walks off)(

So now imagine that same scene with Homestar as The Drunk, and Strong Bad as Lippy.
