I fully realize that 6 inches of water in the basement does not constitute a crisis on the same level as many other people have experienced in their life, but it still sucks. Especially when you realize that your insurance does not cover flooding.

Long story short, our basement flooded yesterday, and with it, we lost a good chunk of wedding gifts, six years worth of Carrie&#8217;s school supplies, and some irreplaceable stuff &#8211; including the digital masters for _Dancing With Gaia_ as well as all the miniDV tapes from all Gravy Train Films productions.

It&#8217;s all gone.
