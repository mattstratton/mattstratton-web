I&#8217;m in a bad mood now.

I&#8217;m going to go to bed before I get in a worse mood.

I&#8217;m upset about things that I rationally shouldn&#8217;t be upset about. Why should I be upset that some of my local friends don&#8217;t want to come to the Black and Tan? I guess maybe not everyone sees it the same way as I do.

I&#8217;m also in a bad mood because it seems like every day I find out that yet another out of town friend who was coming has to cancel.

Like I said, I&#8217;m upset for stupid reasons. I&#8217;m going to go watch Seinfeld and get over it.
