Despite her very busy schedule, which is jam-packed with singing, auditioning, fitness, and being awesome, Erika, was able to take the time to answer a few questions for this interview &#8211; so that the Good Old Rockers could gain a bit of insight into what exactly it means to be a &#8220;professional opera singer&#8221; &#8211; and what&#8217;s the real story behind &#8220;vice-versa&#8221;.

**Why did you move to New York?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  To see if I could.  I literally woke up one morning in May of ’07 and said to myself, “I have to do this.  I’m moving to NYC.”  I felt a little stuck in Chicago, career-wise, and had always been intimidated by the thought of living in Manhattan.  But I knew it was time to give it a try.
</p>

**What has been your most defining &#8220;New York&#8221; experience so far?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  I had my “falling in love” moment on a weekend in October or November, walking through Central park on a perfect crisp day, people-watching, and realizing this was my city now.  But I think my New Yorkiest experiences happen whenever I ride the subway.  There’s always…something.
</p>

**What do you think is something that the average person would never even realize is a reality for a professional opera singer?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  People always seem surprised when I liken it to being a professional athlete.  But the more I chase this dream, the more I feel like an Olympian or something.  Using the voice operatically is SUCH a specialized skill, which involves a ton of muscle coordination and stamina, and usually a teacher or coach to help you find your “zone.”  Performance time is similar to game time; you stop thinking so hard, have fun, and hope the work you put in pays off.  For me, it’s also the perfect balance of athlete-like training AND artistry, because on top of all the physical work that’s done, I’m studying languages, poetry, historical periods, composer biographies, musical styles…and on top of THAT, there’s all the character preparation and acting work…in short, singing opera is extremely fulfilling on multiple levels!
</p>

**On that note&#8230;is the proper term &#8220;professional opera singer&#8221; or something else?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  That works.  Sometimes I say “classical vocalist” or “classical singer,” because I sing art songs, concert pieces, etc., along with performing opera.  But when I say that, people usually respond with, “Classical?  Like an opera singer?”  So, opera singer it is.
</p>

**Who is your hero? Why do you think they are awesome?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Pretty much anyone who does what they want to do in life, and doesn’t care what other people think, is my hero.  Except when people do bad stuff without caring about other people.  <em>Not </em>heroic.
</p>

**You are someone who always seems (to me) to be doing something really smart or cool in terms of exercise or your health. How do you figure out what is important to you in that regard?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Thanks, Matt!  Well, goals are really important to me.  And not goals like, “I will lose 15 pounds” or “I will fit into this pair of pants by July,” but goals like “I will finish a half-marathon” or “I will swim a mile on Saturday.”  I’m really horrible about working out if I don’t have something to train/prepare for, so I did the NYC half-marathon last summer and am racing in at least one triathlon this summer (and am contemplating a marathon, but we’ll see).  Having performance-based goals really keeps me accountable in all areas of my health.  I’m much more likely to go to bed early or pass on greasy food because it will make tomorrow’s workout less pleasant, than because it’ll make me look fat or whatever.
</p>

**What challenges do you see yourself taking on in the next five years?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Completing a half-Ironman distance triathlon.  Maybe also a marathon.  Moving somewhere exotic.  Earning my entire living from singing.  Learning how to play the mandolin.
</p>

**What is your philosophy when it comes to marrying artistic expression with everyday living?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Ooh, we’re getting deep.  I think this answer has two levels.  First, I try to do something for my art/career every day.  Practicing, listening to a new piece, choosing new music I’d like to learn…something to feed the fire.  If I don’t, I start feeling sad.  I think if everyone on the planet took 30 minutes a day to exercise and 30 minutes a day to express themselves in some artistic manner, society would seriously change for the better.  Second, I try to find “art” in the mundane.  Such a cliché, I know.  But let’s take my day job as an example.  Some days my task is to deliver the mail to employees.  I’ll try to choreograph the most efficient mail route and assemble the mail in the most efficient way.  No one else will notice, but little things like that make everyday happenings a bit more fun.
</p>

**What &#8220;non-opera&#8221; jobs have you had? Which has been your favorite? Which one sucked the most?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Let’s see.  I’ve been a coffee shop barista, music librarian, administrative assistant, promotional model, dance instructor, janitor, Texas Hold’Em dealer, telemarketer, retail salesperson, salon receptionist, hair model, and pet sitter.  Currently I work at a hedge fund, which sounds really boring but is actually a sweet set-up…a lot of artistic types work here because they provide a lot of freedom and flexibility for our pursuits.  My worst job was documented in the famed Windyhop thread “Things I Learned At Work,” when I assisted a catalog marketer in the world’s most archane office, complete with cast of freakish co-workers.
</p>

**What is the strangest thing that ever happened to you while you were working in your &#8220;non-opera&#8221; jobs?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  I think the “visa versa” story is still my favorite.  At the aforementioned nightmare job, I got into a fight with my boss because he believed “visa versa” was the correct term, not “vice versa.”  I pulled up the OED online to prove it to him, and he said he would only believe a “real dictionary.”  As in, a physical book.  This was the same boss who had all the computers hooked up to print on typewriters, because he liked the look of the letters better.  Yeah, lots of stories from that job.  A more recent oddity was picking up the main line at work and realizing it was Al Franken calling for one of our employees.  (I refrained from making a Stuart Smalley reference.)
</p>

**I&#8217;ve always found you to be pretty hilarious. How would you define your sense of humor?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Thanks again!  So many compliments!  I love watching people, and I think most of what I observe is hilarious.  So, I guess I would define it as “observational silliness.”
</p>

**What is the absolute funniest thing you&#8217;ve seen/heard/experienced?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  I can’t pick just one thing!  The funniest things are always situational: being with a certain group of people and witnessing or experiencing a specific bizarre event which, at that exact moment, makes you laugh for hours.  But if any part of the equation had been different, would the funny have happened?  What is the sound of one hand clapping?
</p>

**You and I know each other through swing dancing. How would you describe when we first met?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  I don’t remember our first official meeting.  My first recollection of you was at Dallas’ parents’ house in Kentucky.  Tessa and I drove all night, only to wake up you, Disco, Dallas, and Jake at like 5 in the morning.  I believe she pounced on some people.  I was more reserved.  A hilarious weekend ensued, and a friendship was born.
</p>

**As mentioned above, we&#8217;ve known each other for about eight years. What shared experience do you think defines the &#8220;Erika and Matt&#8221; dynamic?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  My favorite memories with you are those “observed silliness” ones.  Like the time we were reading back issues of Playboy and created the centerfold stand-up comedy routine.  Wow, out of context, that sounds like an awful way to define a friendship.  But I think you know what I mean.
</p>

**Do you like muffins? What is your favorite kind of muffin, if so?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Blueberry!
</p>

**Explain &#8220;Erika&#8221; in three words.**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Layers of awesometasticness.
