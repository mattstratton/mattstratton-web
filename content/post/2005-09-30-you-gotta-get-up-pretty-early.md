I woke up a little earlier than my &#8220;roommates&#8221; this morning, due to an annoying beeping sound. Since I couldn&#8217;t get back to sleep, I got dressed and went downstairs to play some blackjack.

I won $100 in about 45 minutes. Combined with yesterday&#8217;s poker loss, I am now &#8220;up&#8221; eleven bucks. Sweet!

Oh, for those of you who don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m currently in Atlantic City with Larry and Partytom. As soon as these two Snoozy McSnoozersons wake up, we&#8217;ll be heading into NYC where we&#8217;ll meet up with Kim and then it&#8217;s time for the Y7A party to begin in earnest.

As the kids say, w00t.
