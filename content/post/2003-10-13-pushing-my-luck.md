So building on my [success][1] with the Win2K Pro exam last week, I&#8217;ve gotten impatient with my [Microsoft certification][2].

So on Wednesday, I&#8217;ll be taking [**Exam 70-218 Managing a Microsoft Windows 2000 Network Environment**][3], and next Tuesday I&#8217;ve got [**Exam 70-215 Installing, Configuring, and Administering Microsoft Windows 2000 Server**][4] and [**Exam 70-244 Supporting and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Network**][5].

Wish me luck! If all goes according to plan, I&#8217;ll be an MCSA a week from tomorrow.

For those of you playing at home&#8230;I earned my Windows NT MCSE in 1998, and my CCNA in 1999.
