So a couple weeks ago, this chick replied to my CL ad. She was very funny, and pretty dialed-into the improv scene here in Chicago.

We emailed and im-ed for about a week, and then made plans to meet up for dinner last Friday (the 18th). We were supposed to go get tapas at Ba-Ba-Ree-Ba, but when we arrived, the wait for a table was very long (and she was on a schedule; she had to tech at a show at the Playground at 10). We ended up going to the Red Lion for drinks and some pub food.

It was nice. She&#8217;s pretty cute, and pretty funny. We split a cab back from the Lion, and the cab dropped me off first. So&nbsp; when I got out, there was a weird goodbye moment &#8211; sitting in the back of a cab is a tough time to do any kind of hug or whatnot, so it turned into a little mini handtouch/shake thing.

We were supposed to go out again this past weekend, but she got sick. Today she im-ed me and asked me to go see The Life Aquatic at the Brew and View on Thursday night. We shall see what happens.
