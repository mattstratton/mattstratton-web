So I&#8217;m out of town again&#8230;

This afternoon I leave for NYC. Not as long of a trip as Atlanta (I&#8217;ll be back Monday afternoon), but should be a good time.

Tonight I&#8217;m going to meet up with Larry at the airport, then we&#8217;ll grab some food and head to Penthouse (which better NOT be lounger-unfriendly, is all I&#8217;m sayin&#8217;).

Tomorrow night I&#8217;m going to see Ian Roberts&#8217;s show at [The Upright Citizens Brigade][1]. Dunno what happens after that.

Saturday night I guess there&#8217;s a party in Brooklyn or something.

Sunday night is ASSSSCAT long-form improv at UCB.

And then Monday I come home. And go to Fizz. And Kate better fucking be there, or I will throw ninja stars at her.
