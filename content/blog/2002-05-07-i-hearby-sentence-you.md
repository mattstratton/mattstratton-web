&#8230;to wasting away precious hours on [The Laser Game][1].

Sherman showed this to me last week. Since then, both Dallas and Trapper have fallen under its spell.

Personally, I can&#8217;t get past level 20 yet. But I haven&#8217;t had much time to dedicate to Level 20 since achieving it on Friday before going home.
