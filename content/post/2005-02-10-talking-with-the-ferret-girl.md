So I&#8217;m im-ing with Ferret Girl today &#8230;

FYI &#8211; she&#8217;s been dating this dude for a while now, so I figured this was a safe time to have this conversation.

**Mugsy:** so this is a little High Fidelity
  
**Ferret Girl:** Shoot!
  
**Ferret Girl:** Okay&#8230;
  
**Mugsy:** but I&#8217;m really trying to figure some stuff out
  
**Mugsy:** and I know you have told me in the past that you&#8217;re a messed up person, but let&#8217;s just put a pin in that for now ;)
  
**Mugsy:** I&#8217;m just trying to figure out if there is something I do, or whatever, that puts women off
  
**Mugsy:** I think you&#8217;re in a position to be able to give me some honest and useful feedback
  
**Ferret Girl:** Something you &#8220;did&#8221;?
  
**Ferret Girl:** Hardly!
  
**Ferret Girl:** I think I felt I put you off, actually.
  
**Ferret Girl:** I guess I felt that I didn&#8217;t have alot of interesting things to offer.
  
**Ferret Girl:** You&#8217;re making movies, have tons of awesome friends, tons of interesting stories/adventures/trips
  
**Ferret Girl:** it amazes me how skewed my vision is when dating.
  
**Ferret Girl:** When I started datign Shannon, he seemed way too interested in everything I did or said, I couldn&#8217;t believe anyone could find li&#8217;l old me that interesting.
  
**Mugsy:** (amusing sidenote &#8211; that&#8217;s exactly my reply to your comment about how I was doing all these things and you had nothing to offer)
  
**Mugsy:** so how did you get past that?
  
**Ferret Girl:** It took him beating it into my head that yes he really did find me interesting (like I said &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty neurotic!)
  
**Ferret Girl:** My only advice to you would be to ask the girl lots of questions, see what she likes to do/eat/read. Don&#8217;t feel threatened, and have a good time. :D
  
**Ferret Girl:** I remember when we went out with Chris to 500 Clown and in the cab I was sitting in the middle but you weren&#8217;t talking much to me &#8211; I felt like I was scaring you or something.
  
**Mugsy:** hmm
  
**Mugsy:** yeah, I tend to get easily steamrolled. I know that&#8217;s something I need to work on
  
**Ferret Girl:** The show was awesome, and we laughed alot, so I decided it was all in my head, but then we sat apart at Peninsula Club, so I thought, &#8220;&#8230;.or maybe i DO scare him&#8230;.?&#8221;
  
**Ferret Girl:** DAMMIT! WORK ON THAT!
  
**Ferret Girl:** YOU&#8217;RE FREAKING AWESOME!
  
**Ferret Girl:** :D
  
**Ferret Girl:** I hope you realize that.
  
**Mugsy:** ha, and see, I&#8217;m sitting there thinking &#8220;dont&#8217; want to be too forward&#8221;
  
**Ferret Girl:** You&#8217;re definitely not too forward!

Then she got called away to do some work.

So the gist is&#8230;apparently I don&#8217;t know how to interact with woman.
