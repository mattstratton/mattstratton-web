Last week, Carrie and I bought a new TV, since [the old one][1] was just too huge. It&#8217;s a [42&#8243; Panasonic plasma][2], and we&#8217;re really happy with it.

On Friday, we went shopping to find a stand for it (it was delivered on Thursday, and the only thing I had strong enough to hold it was my poker table &#8211; not exactly nice furniture). We started at the Target on Elston, but they didn&#8217;t have anything we liked. We then tried Harlem Furniture and Wickes, but they didn&#8217;t have anything either. Costco likewise turned up a bust, and so did K-Mart. We finally decided to take a look at the Target on Addison, on the whim that maybe they&#8217;d have different stock than the Target on Elston.

They did. We found a stand we loved. We bought it. I put it together on Friday night.

We are happy.

Also, our new bed was delivered this morning. We finally have a queen-sized bed. This makes sleeping with two people and one dog a lot more comfy.

Incidentally, if you know anyone in the Chicago area who wants a nice (but huge) Sony HDTV, point them towards my Craigslist ad.
