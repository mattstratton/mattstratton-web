I know none of you have seen &#8220;Inventing: Music&#8221;, but Dallas and I have been working on our &#8220;summarizing&#8221; skills, and these are the ones we&#8217;ve come up with:

&#8220;Inventing: Music&#8221; is&#8230;

&#8230;about the stories we tell to impress, and how we start to believe them ourselves.

&#8230;about how the way in which we view ourselves rearranges the way we see and remember the world.

&#8230;about how our fantasies of rebellion don&#8217;t&#8211;and can&#8217;t&#8211;play out in real life.

&#8230;about how guys will do anything to impress a woman&#8211;even pulling a gun on them in a cubicle.

&#8230;the best damn 10 minute film involving a hippie man-child with a guitar and lawn chair you&#8217;ll see in 2003!
