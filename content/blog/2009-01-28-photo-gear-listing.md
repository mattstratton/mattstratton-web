As promised, a post about photography gear.

A caveat, if you will, before we begin. I am not a professional photographer by any means. I am strictly a hobbiest. But I think that I&#8217;m certainly improving with experience, and I believe I am worthy of my <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">tools</span> toys.

Here&#8217;s a breakdown of my photo gear.

**Canon Digital Rebel XT 350D** &#8211; This is the body I shoot with. It was a wedding present from my wife, and gifted to me shortly before our <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mugsy/collections/72157600317322284/" target="_blank">honeymoon in Costa Rica</a>. Would I like to shoot on a 50D? Of course. Would it make a great difference in the quality of the photos I create? I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m ready to justify that.

**Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6** &#8211; The &#8220;kit lens&#8221; that came with my Rebel. It&#8217;s my &#8220;walking around&#8221; lens, and it&#8217;s not great. If there&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to replace in my aresenal, it&#8217;s this lens.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-Camera-Lens/dp/B00007E7JU%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00007E7JU" target="_blank"><strong>Canon EF 50mm f/1.8</strong></a> &#8211; The good old &#8220;nifty fifty&#8221;. I break this glass out every now and again. Definitely worth the $75 or so that I spent on it &#8211; it gives me some freedom to play, and I&#8217;ve gotten my mileage out of it. It&#8217;s pretty slow to focus in low light, which is a pain, but it&#8217;s definitely the fastest glass I own.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-75-300mm-4-5-6-Telephoto-Cameras/dp/B00004THD0%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00004THD0" target="_blank"><strong>Canon EF 75</strong><strong>-300mm f/4-5.6</strong></a> &#8211; I thought this lens was cool as ice when I bought it (used, natch), but I&#8217;ve since found that it&#8217;s kind of cruddy. It&#8217;s definitely muddy, especially at full zoom. However, it&#8217;s telephoto to the max; 300mm on the non-full frame sensor is a ridiculous amount of zoom. It was essential for <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mugsy/sets/72157600320469059/" target="_blank">wildlife photography in Costa Rica</a>, but I rarely use it anymore, mostly because I&#8217;m unhappy with the quality.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sigma-10-20mm-4-5-6-Digital-Cameras/dp/B0007U00X0%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0007U00X0" target="_blank"><strong>Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6</strong></a> &#8211; My most recent lens. Bought it used, but as we all know, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with used glass. The highest quality lens I own. It&#8217;s a lot of fun at 10mm, but at 20mm I find it very useful and super crisp. Quite pleased.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joby-Gorillapod-SLR-Zoom-Flexible-Digital/dp/B000KFRSG4%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000KFRSG4" target="_blank"><strong>Joby GP3 Gorillapod SLR-Zoom Flexible Tripod</strong></a> &#8211; This has proven to be essential, so far, with my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mugsy/sets/72157612213865503/" target="_blank">52 Weeks project</a> (self-portraits). I wish it had the quick-release capabilities that the smaller Gorillapods have though.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Deluxe-Backpack-200EG-Cameras/dp/B00009R6TA%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00009R6TA" target="_blank"><strong>Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG</strong></a> &#8211; I&#8217;m somewhat bag-obsessed; I am still struggling to find the perfect bag (Actually, I have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OOGCV2?ie=UTF8&tag=straigeyefort-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001OOGCV2" target="_blank">found it</a>, I just can&#8217;t justify spending the money on it). This is another relatively recent purchase, so I haven&#8217;t put it through its paces completely, but so far it&#8217;s working out well for storing all my gear. The tripod straps on the side work well with the Gorillapod.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lowepro-SlingShot-All-Weather-Digital-Backpack/dp/B000BAX50G%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000BAX50G" target="_blank"><strong>Lowepro SlingShot 100</strong></a> &#8211; This is the smaller camera backpack I use. It is less cumbersome than the Canon backpack, and it holds the body and two lenses pretty well. I find it weird to wear though, and it&#8217;s not flattering on someone of the &#8220;lunchbox&#8221; persuasion.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Deluxe-Gadget-Bag-100EG/dp/B00004WCGF" target="_blank"><strong>Canon Deluxe Gadget Bag 100EG</strong></a> &#8211; The third and final (for now) camera bag. This exists so that my wife doesn&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a big dork carrying around a big camera bag. Also, I bought it at Target.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Wireless-Remote-Control-Digital/dp/B00004WCIC%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00004WCIC" target="_blank"><strong>Canon Wireless Remote Control</strong></a> &#8211; Another necessity for the self-portraits. I like this one as it has the option of working either with a 2 second timer or an instant shutter.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-III-memory-CompactFlash/dp/B0007QU70U%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0007QU70U" target="_blank"><strong>SanDisk Extreme III 2 GB CF card</strong></a> &#8211; I have two of these (as well as some 1 and 2 GB CF cards that are slower). I really like the high speed of these cards, and I prefer to have many 2 GB cards rather than one or two larger capactity cards. It just seems safer.

A couple things that are more on the processing side of the equation:

**Adobe Photoshop CS4** &#8211; Yes, maybe it&#8217;s overkill, and Elements might do most of what I want to do, but I love me some Photoshop. I&#8217;m tickled pink with CS4; Bridge is finally useable, and there are some amazing features of Photoshop that blow my mind (Content-Aware Scaling, anyone?) More about how I use Photoshop in a later post.

<a href="https://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/xpsdt_630" target="_blank"><strong>Dell XPS 630</strong></a> &#8211; It&#8217;s a gaming computer, but it&#8217;s also a great Photoshop computer. 6 GB of RAM, quad-core  processor, and honkin&#8217; video card. I likes it.  Prior to this computer I did all my Photoshoppin&#8217; on a Mac Mini.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pantone-MEU101-huey/dp/B000CR78C4%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000CR78C4" target="_blank"><strong>Pantone huey</strong></a> &#8211; Correct color is key. I can&#8217;t recommend this enough to anyone who takes their digital photography seriously. It&#8217;s a cheap thrill and absolutely necessary.

So those are my weapons. I have a bunch of other items I didn&#8217;t include, like some filters, but since I never use them, I figured it was silly to mention them. I&#8217;m happy with what I&#8217;ve got, although I&#8217;d like to ditch the kit lens for something better, and it&#8217;s certainly enough to meet my needs for the time being.
