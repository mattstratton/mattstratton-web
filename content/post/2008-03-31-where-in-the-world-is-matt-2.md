If I&#8217;ve been somewhat AWOL lately, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m suffering from Sonic Death Flu. I came down with it on Wednesday night, and it&#8217;s been kicking my ass since then. I stayed home from work on Thursday and Friday, and then was home all weekend by myself (Carrie was in Michigan visiting some friends). I attempted to go into work this morning, but was sent back home for quarantine reasons. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be well enough to go to work tomorrow, and definitely hoping to be well enough to go to the Cubs game on Wednesday (that&#8217;s doubtful though).
