Just a little housekeeping information for you, dear readers.

**Item the first** &#8211; I have just updated to the latest version of my WordPress theme,Â <a href="http://wordpress.bytesforall.com/?cat=15" target="_blank">Atahualpa</a>. I haven&#8217;t noticed any oddness (yet), but if you do encounter any layout bugs, please let me know. Of course, as soon as I finished the update I read that the developer is planning a new release &#8220;any day now&#8221;. Well, at least I got some practice doing the update.

**Item the second** &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect/" target="_blank">Google Friend Connect</a> is now enabled for this site. So if you have a Friend Connect account, you should see a nifty &#8220;social bar&#8221; accross the top of the page when you are on Good Old Rock. This is an experiment to see how useful it actually ends up being, so I would really appreciate your feedback.
