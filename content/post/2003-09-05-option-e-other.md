**TIP OF MY ICEBERG** 

   _Last great book I read_

The DaVinci Code. And just before that, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. Although I did just finish re-reading Fight Club on the L today.

   _Most humbling moment_

Not receiving the Democratic Presidential nomination

_Celebrity I resemble most_

\*Not\* Carrot Top

_Best (or worst) lie I&#8217;ve ever told_

&#8216;Of \*course\* I have a permit to film here!&#8217;

_If I could be anywhere at the moment_

Sitting in the park, looking out over Lake Michigan, surrounded by small containers of pudding.

_Song or album that puts me in the mood_

Liz Phair, every time.

_The five items I can&#8217;t live without_

Sushi
  
Movies
  
Backrubs
  
Oxygen
  
Pickles

   _Fill in the blanks_

A nice ass is sexy;
  
a smart ass is sexier

_In my bedroom, you&#8217;ll find_

A lot of movie equipment (wait, not for the reasons you think!)

**WHY YOU SHOULD GET TO KNOW ME** 
   
I&#8217;m damn funny. Plus, everyone says I&#8217;m a good listener. It&#8217;s well-documented&#8230;ask anyone! Seriously. Ask the next person you see on the street if I&#8217;m a good listener.

But besides that&#8230;I&#8217;m considerate, but I&#8217;m no pushover. I&#8217;ve got eclectic interests that range from wine to swing dancing to bowling to films. Plus, I cook and clean up after myself with great aplomb. And I use words like &#8216;aplomb&#8217;. Even when I&#8217;m not sure what they mean.

**MORE ABOUT WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR**
   
Someone funny and independent. A women that makes me laugh and makes me excited. I&#8217;m comfortable with who I am, and I want a girl who&#8217;s comfortable with me too.

I don&#8217;t think I can make a laundry list of requirements for who I want to meet &#8211; be interesting and different, and I bet I&#8217;ll like you.
