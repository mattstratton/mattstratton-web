Well, we&#8217;ve incorporated&#8230;

Don&#8217;t have the paperwork and tax ID yet (that&#8217;s coming on Wednesday), but we are now officially Gravy Train Films, Limited.

Yup. We&#8217;re an S-Corp. I feel all&#8230;businesslike.

(For those of you wondering&#8230;I am the President and Treasurer. DT is the Vice-President and Secretary. I am the President because I&#8217;m the one who did the paperwork. Neener.)

Interesting things I learned today:

1) If you are not actually filming anywhere on public properly, the City of Chicago doesn&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s ass about what you do. However, a nice lade named Kathy Byrne at the City of Chicago Film Office would **love** to hear more about our project. Guess I have to find someone to do PR for GTF ;)

2) Equipment insurance and liability is fucking PRICEY. Like, 20% of my budget pricey. Fuck.

3) It ain&#8217;t easy to find a squad car to put in your movie. Even if you don&#8217;t want it to actually be driving.

4) DP&#8217;s love to spend money. Even when you tell them &#8220;we&#8217;re way over budget, so I need to know where we can cut things from lighting,&#8221; you somehow walk away from that conversation with MORE expenses.

5) UHF wireless mics have less interference than VHF. They also cost more. And are impossible to find on eBay.

6) Good luck finding used c-stands to buy. Used Arri fresnels? Easily done. Oh, but you want to MOUNT them on something&#8230;lots of luck.

7) If you don&#8217;t shield an Arri, bugs will fly into it and cause it to explode, sending molten glass everywhere (please note I did NOT learn this through experience).

8) QuickTime movies render faster in iMovie when you turn your screensaver off.

9) Everyone on your crew has one mission in life &#8211; to spend your money.
