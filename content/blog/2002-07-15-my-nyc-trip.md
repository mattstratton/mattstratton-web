OK, first of all, this is a &#8220;friends-only&#8221; post, because I might just say something less than nice about someone, and I&#8217;m trusting you all to keep this between us&#8230;because I know some of you (I&#8217;m looking at YOU, Jodie and Nando), will know **exactly** who I am talking about.

First, the breakdown of the weekend.

Thursday, I arrived in the early evening. Larry and Roberta picked me up at the airport, I saw Larry&#8217;s broom closet of an apartment, and we had dinner at Go Sushi. Which was less than delicious.

Then we went the Pennsylvania Hotel (the inspiration for the song &#8220;Pennsylvania 6-5000&#8221;) to see a pretty cool, authentic swing band. Afterwards, we went to the Penthouse (this Lindy/Westie DJ dance). I had a couple cocktails with Swank, and chatted with some friends both old and new. Swank dropped me off at my host&#8217;s house in Jersey City, and that was that.

Friday, I met up with Larry and Roberta and we did some shopping in his neighborhood (I think he lives in Midtown). I discovered that Barney&#8217;s is just like the stores in Boystown, in that I&#8217;m way too fat (and not nearly gay enough) to shop there, apparently. But I picked up some great linen pants at Banana Republic on the advice of Roberta, and I think I looked damn good.

Saw Ian Robert&#8217;s one-man show &#8220;Am I A Bonehead?&#8221; Basically, it was a 45 minute monologue about his experience with weightlifting and physical fitness. Yet, somehow, it was damn funny. Not really improv, but still, I enjoyed it immensely.

Went to get sushi afterwards with Sonia, Christine, Nando, Larry, Roberta, and Noelle. Then we were off to Cache, a pretty cool little lounge with a good band. I took up my usual post (right at the bar) and tossed back quite a few cocktails with my lounger friends (some old and some new), and made friends with Will, the bartender. After Cache closed, I went to Swing 46, had another drink with Asher, and then it was time to go home. My host had problems with her car, and we didn&#8217;t make it back to Jersey City until 6 AM. So the beach plans for Saturday were basically kiboshed.

Saturday afternoon we went into Manhattan so she could return some stuff, and I picked up another new outfit (Hugo Boss pants at a 75% discount, and a linen shirt&#8230;nice!) We went to a cool party in Red Hook (part of Brooklyn) and I sat and talked to Frank for a long time &#8211; we haven&#8217;t seen each other since Julie&#8217;s party back in November, so we caught each other up on projects &#8211; I updated him on Dancing With Gaia, and he brought me up to speed on [ILL Clan][1].

Sunday morning I got together with Frank and two of his ILL Clan buddies &#8211; Matt and Paul &#8211; to do some improv. We basically were just riffing &#8211; I don&#8217;t think they are going to be able to use any of the material we recorded, but hopefully it will help them with some writing. It was completely fun to play again.

Sunday evening was dinner at Republic, and then off to see ASSSSCAT at [Upright Citizens Brigade][2]. We were in luck &#8211; Matt Walsh and Ian Roberts were playing, along with two other guys who I didn&#8217;t recognize (despite one of them being &#8220;of Second City fame&#8221; :). Some really great work &#8211; it was damn funny. I am not sure how I feel about the ASSSSCAT form &#8211; from what Nando tells me, it&#8217;s a modified Armando, which I am not in love with &#8211; but for what they were doing, there was some really phemomenal communication and risks. They did bring back one premise which disappointed me &#8211; primarily because they didn&#8217;t do anything different with it. But that&#8217;s the risks you take.

Then, today, I came home.

Now, for the bitching&#8230;

There is one person I saw this weekend in NYC that annoys me to no end. And I always forget that this person annoys me. Primarily the problem is that this person has really poor communication skills; they interrupt all the time, and don&#8217;t really care about having a dialogue, they prefer a monologue. The funniest thing was last night, when we were discussing the UCB show, this person (to whom I&#8217;d only been able to say about ten words all weekend) said to me &#8220;See, I feel like you are talking TO me, not having a conversation WITH me.&#8221;

Argh.

The thing that makes me sad is, this person will continue to be this way, because nobody really cares enough to tell this person that they need to make these changes.

It&#8217;s additionally amusing because said person has many books in their apartment about being a &#8220;listener&#8221; and communications.

Sigh.
