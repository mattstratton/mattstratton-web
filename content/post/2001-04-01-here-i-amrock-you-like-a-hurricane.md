You know&#8230;this is truly a random thing. Who really cares what I have to say? On the other hand, who **wouldn&#8217;t** care? I&#8217;m very interesting, dammit.

It&#8217;s Sunday. Stupid DST makin&#8217; me mess with clocks and shit. I&#8217;m sitting here at my computer wondering if I should work on Windyhop, or just watch some TV. I&#8217;m thinking TV is gonna be the winner. I&#8217;m quite lazy today.

I start a new dance lesson this evening&#8230;with my favorite instructors. It&#8217;s Intermediate/Advanced Lindy, and I don&#8217;t mind telling you, I&#8217;m a little nervous. I&#8217;m don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m up to that level of instruction, but E and N know me well enough that if I wasn&#8217;t, they would have told me before I signed up for the lesson. So there.

It&#8217;s a very nice, sunny day out. I&#8217;ll be so happy when it&#8217;s warm enough for biking again.
