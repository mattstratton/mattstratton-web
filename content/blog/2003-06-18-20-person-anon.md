So apparently the way this works&#8230;you comment on 20 people on your friendslist, without identifying them, and people are a-pposed to guess who you&#8217;re talking about?

1. You&#8217;ve got your finger on the pulse of popular culture. It&#8217;s right there. It&#8217;s not far away from the pulse, jammed straight up your ass.

2. One day we&#8217;re getting married. You know this. You just refuse to accept it. But even if we got married, you&#8217;d probably still refuse to sleep with me.

3. You&#8217;re one of my favorite people because you&#8217;re such a goof. And you say things like &#8220;w00t&#8221;, but it doesn&#8217;t come off lame when you do it. Plus, for the puppy.

4. I loaf you lots. Cinnamon raisin loaf, even.

5. You are one of the truest people I have been lucky enough to meet. I sure wish you&#8217;d see yourself for as great as you are.
