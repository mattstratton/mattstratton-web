_From this week&#8217;s [Entertainment Weekly][1]_

Joel Stein on why he&#8217;ll &#8221;steal&#8221; from Ben Affleck. Lucy Liu and other celebs are pleading poverty in a PSA
  
by Joel Stein

Nothing makes someone more unlikable than their unawareness of what makes them unlikable. That&#8217;s the main reason why people don&#8217;t like Los Angeles. It&#8217;s not surprising, then, that Hollywood&#8217;s answer to the advent of DVD burners and Internet piracy is a clueless public service announcement in which Ben Affleck, Lucy Liu, and &#8221;Titanic&#8221; director James Cameron ask you not to steal from them. Next they&#8217;ll produce a PSA about how small trailers can cause claustrophobia.

In May, Affleck&#8217;s 1-minute-12-second plea will unspool on movie screens nationwide; it&#8217;ll be the Will Rogers Institute can-rattle of our time. But this appeal is for the fair treatment of movie stars, not the compassionate support of sick kids &#8212; or sick horses, or sick kids who ride horses. Frankly, it was never clear to me what the Will Rogers fund was about &#8212; other than the chance to impress my date by kicking in some change.

I got a tape of the Twentieth Century Fox-produced PSA last weekend, while camped out at the Mandalay Bay, a billion-dollar Vegas casino and resort that wanted 60 bucks to rent me a VCR. Rather than pony up, I knocked on the door of the Mandalay Bay medic&#8217;s office, which I was told had video gear. The freelance EMTs on call let me in without question. Affleck hadn&#8217;t finished his first line when one of them yelled, &#8221;When you&#8217;re making $300 million a year, don&#8217;t say, &#8216;I need more.&#8217; &#8221; When I told her that I was writing a column precisely about this absurdity, she asked for anonymity, afraid that she&#8217;d &#8221;get in trouble.&#8221; Affleck, it turns out, is even more powerful than I thought. &#8221;It would be a cute commercial if there was a real cause behind it,&#8221; the other EMT offered. &#8221;But they could at least have said something about drunk driving. I&#8217;m going home and downloading &#8216;Daredevil&#8217; tonight.&#8221;

But Affleck&#8217;s point, on second viewing, wasn&#8217;t that he&#8217;s Benny from the Block and in need of scratch. It&#8217;s that the less well-paid are in jeopardy if piracy blunts studios&#8217; profits. &#8221;The movie you&#8217;re about to see is the work of hundreds of people,&#8221; says Affleck in the PSA. &#8221;Not just the stars you see on screen,&#8221; but writers, cameramen, costumers, and countless others. Apparently, there is a world in which the proletariat includes the guy who penned &#8221;Point Break.&#8221;

Basically, the PSA argues that fewer movies will be made if piracy runs amok. A fewer-movie policy, I would counterargue, might spare us &#8221;The Core.&#8221; Also, I can&#8217;t figure out why they would show this PSA to people who&#8217;ve just paid full price for admission, instead of shoving it at the front end of a DVD, where actual criminals might see it, since the only people Internet pirates truly put out of business are the in-theater camcorder crooks.

When I asked Motion Picture Association of America president Jack Valenti whether the director of the highest-grossing movie of all time was the ideal spokesperson against petty theft, he tap-danced. &#8221;I found the most convincing part to be the working stiffs,&#8221; said Valenti of the PSA, &#8221;the guys who have a modest home and kids who go to public schools. They make $75,000 to $100,000 a year. That&#8217;s not much to live on. I don&#8217;t have to tell you that,&#8221; he said, vastly overestimating the U.S. poverty level and what I get paid for this column. I vowed right then not only to pirate a movie but also to find a way to use the Internet to steal directly from Jack Valenti&#8217;s home.

So now I&#8217;m pro-piracy. First, piracy is too cool-sounding to oppose. And the ownership of &#8221;intellectual property&#8221; is a myth created by ingenious nerds. Can ideas be owned? Am I supposed to pay Metallica every time I hum &#8221;Enter Sandman&#8221; or mail Pam Anderson a wad of cash each time I&#8217;m alone in a hotel room recounting the lone plot twist from &#8221;Barb Wire&#8221;? Wouldn&#8217;t that moral dilemma be resolved if Time Inc. would just allow me to expense Spectravision?

I&#8217;ll still rent DVDs and see movies in theaters. But I&#8217;ll download them too. And after watching that PSA, I&#8217;m especially going to steal Affleck flicks. As soon as he makes one worth stealing.
