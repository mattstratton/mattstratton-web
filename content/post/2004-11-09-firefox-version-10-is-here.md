For those of you who are still on IE&#8230;try the **5 Days With Firefox Challenge**

1. Read the &#8220;[Why Use Firefox?][1]&#8221; document
  
2. Go [download Firefox][2] and install it
  
3. Use Firefox as you default browser for 5 days
  
4. If, after 5 days, you&#8217;re still not convinced that Firefox is the best browser there is, uninstall it and switch back.

Yes, Trapper, I know that sometimes you have to use IE in a corporate setting&#8230;blah blah blah. That&#8217;s why I have IE on my work laptop, but I only use it for our intranet stuff. Firefox is for outside browsing.
