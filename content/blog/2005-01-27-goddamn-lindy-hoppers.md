Now this one really truly drives me up a fucking wall.

What&#8217;s the big deal with taking three and a half years to leave a dance? Especially at four in the morning? It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re going off to Vietnam. Why do you have to say goodbye to everyone you know that is there? Especially when you&#8217;re going to see all of them again in like 8 hours at the afternoon dance.

And that&#8217;s just Exchanges.

Me? If I run into you on my way out the door, I&#8217;ll say goodbye. If you&#8217;re a hot redhead who&#8217;ll give me a tongue kiss, I might go out of my way to wave. But even that&#8217;s not a given.
