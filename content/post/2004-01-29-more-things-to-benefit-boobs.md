My good friend <a href="http://dailykitty.blogspot.com" target="_new">Kitty</a> is doing that Avon Walk thing. And one of the things she&#8217;s doing to raise money for it is playing some cool music. And you can come listen to it!

Here is what she has to say about it:

_Please join me on Friday, February 13th for An Evening with Kitty Mortland: Live and Unplugged at Big City Swing Studio, 1012 W. Randolph. I will be performing songs from my upcoming album &#8220;Hamburg,&#8221; as well as some tried and true cover songs all in honor/protest of Valentine&#8217;s Day. What better way to spend Valentine&#8217;s Day Eve than listening to folky chick music, right? Though I do have a few nice, sincere love songs in my catalog for those of you who have found that special someone.</p> 

The evening will include coffee, water, little snackies, and a few special guest appearances (Mr. Tom Beeyachski, himself, for example), so you are going to want to make sure you don&#8217;t miss this event!

Admission is a mere TEN DOLLARS and doors open at 8:30pm. All proceeds from the event will be put towards my fundraising goal for the walk.

Couple of quick things to mention: the location is a dance studio, so there aren&#8217;t a whole lot of chairs. If you want to bring a folding chair or a picnic blanket so you can pretend you&#8217;re at Ravinia, but inside, feel free. Also, if you want anything to drink besides coffee and water (read: alcohol), you must be of legal age, and you&#8217;re going to have to bring it yourself. Oh, and there will be some adult language used in some of the songs.

But come on out! Bring your friends! Bring your neighbors! Bring your friend&#8217;s neighbors and your neighbor&#8217;s friends! And thank you thank you thank you for your support!!!</i>
