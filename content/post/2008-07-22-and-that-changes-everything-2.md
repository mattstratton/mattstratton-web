So you remember last week when I posted about the two houses we were trying to choose between? And how I said we had a lot of thinking to do? And, I can&#8217;t stress this enough, that we were choosing between those two houses?

I was full of it. Because we have found a THIRD house. And this house is much better than those two. And it&#8217;s the current front-runner in our choices.

[**The Blackhawk House**][1]<img src="http://pics.livejournal.com/mattstratton/pic/0001cepz/s320x240" border="0" alt="" width="240" height="160" align="right" />
  
It is a four bedroom, 2.5 bath in Lisle. Lot and lots of updates &#8211; great kitchen, new fixtures, new appliances, and nicely updated (and brand new) crown molding. The yard is fenced in and a decent size, with good, mature trees. The basement is about half finished. Basically, it&#8217;s a size that we can stick with for the next ten years, which is exactly what I would like. We looked at two other houses in the same subdivision, and after we saw one of them, Carrie noticed a couple that looked to be about our age with a little kid and a Golden &#8211; she asked them about the neighborhood, and it sounds like a good mix of older folks and then younger couples with kids.

Lisle was recently listed in _Money_ magazine as [One Of The Awesomest Places To Live][2] or something. Yes, it is Naperville-adjacent, but we wouldn&#8217;t have an actual Naperville address, so that has to count for something.  The house is 2 miles from the train station, 3 miles from my sister&#8217;s house, 6 miles from Carrie&#8217;s parents, 9 miles from my parents, and 10 miles from Carrie&#8217;s work. It&#8217;s right by 355 and I-88, so highway access is great.

This just might be our new house. I&#8217;ll keep you updated with what we decide.
