When I&#8217;m feeling lazy on a Friday, a sure-fire &#8220;fun&#8221; post is to share with you Good Old Rockers some of the hilarious search terms that lead people to this blog. Here&#8217;s the latest!

**evite harvest** &#8211; This search term actually got someone to my [post about Evite and spam][1], and this intrepid Googler felt the need to leave me a nastygram. Fun times!

**pimp google reader** &#8211; I wonder if they meant &#8220;pimp&#8221; as a noun or a verb. It would be funny if people were looking for a specific Google Reader for use by pimps. Or maybe a Google device for reading your pimps. The variations are endless! Okay, maybe there&#8217;s just the two.

**yelp mud bath** &#8211; This just plain scares me. Did they want a <a href="https://yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a> review of mud baths? Or a mud bath that makes someone yelp?

**what does unyk acronym mean?** &#8211; I kind of want to know this one myself.

**here i am dancing like a hurricane** &#8211; Best search term ever. EVER.
