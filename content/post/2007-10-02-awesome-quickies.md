  1. Cubs are in the playoffs. This is awesome. I could not get tickets, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less awesome. We&#8217;ll see if they can do some magic in Arizona. I&#8217;m predicting Cubs in four.
  2. Went camping this weekend with awesome people. Pictures [here][1]. 
  3. Carrie and I joined an awesome new gym. Had a good workout last night and looking forward to another good one tomorrow.
  4. There is no #4. What, three awesome things aren&#8217;t enough for you?
