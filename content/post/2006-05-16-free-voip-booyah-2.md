I&#8217;ve played with Skype every now and again (by &#8220;played with&#8221; I mean &#8220;installed it and talked to Marcelo once&#8221;). However, I know that my mother uses it to talk to her sister in Denmark.

Anyway, until the end of 2006, [outgoing calls to &#8220;regular&#8221; phones (aka &#8220;SkypeOut&#8221;) within the US and Canada is free][2]. This is neat. I installed Skype again, and just tried to make a few phone calls with it (after pairing my new Bluetooth headset to my Mac).

It worked great. So, for the rest of the year, I think I have my new &#8220;work at home&#8221; outgoing phone. Which will save quite a few of the old mobile phone minutes, lemme tell ya.

Give it a try. I&#8217;m &#8220;mattstratton&#8221; on Skype.
