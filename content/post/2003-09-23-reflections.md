I was talking to a friend yesterday&#8230;.and unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have the AIM log from the conversation&#8230;but the gist was simply this: I&#8217;ve been single for almost three years now. If you&#8217;d told me a few years ago that I&#8217;d have gone that long without being involved, I would have been pretty surprised, and thought you were full of crap. Mostly because we all know that time travel isn&#8217;t possible without a Delorean, and where the hell would you dig one of those up these days?

But actually, I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with it. I&#8217;ve been on a few dates recently with various webbernet girls&#8230;and mostly just been annoyed with the process. Therefore, I shall from now on consider myself a Tivosexual &#8211; I only have a relationship with my Tivo.

The end.
