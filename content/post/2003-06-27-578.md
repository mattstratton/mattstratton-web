So last night, I ended up going out with Backstreet to celebrate the fact that I maybe probably almost for sure have a new job.

We went to the Jefferson Tap for the Thursday night swing dancing debacle. Neither of us had been to that event yet (we&#8217;d both gone in December to see the Tom Beeyachski band play when it was still called &#8220;Knockouts&#8221;).

So we were sitting at the bar, and Backstreet says &#8220;You know, this is a cool venue&#8230;but they need better people.&#8221;

I agreed and said &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s like they did an experiment and put all the people in the swing scene who annoy me into the same room.&#8221;

Luckly, a bit later, some cool folk showed up and offset the annoyers. Had a coupld cocktails, met the cute bartender (not the one all the girls like, but the chick), and talked to Backstreet about movie stuff.

All in all, a pretty fun night.
