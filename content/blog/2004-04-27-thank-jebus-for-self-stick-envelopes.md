I just finished doing a lot of envelope stuffing.

Had to put together submissions to the following festivals for both _Inventing: Stephen_ and _Inventing: Music_ (so each festival equals two packages &#8211; each package meaning AT LEAST filling out a form, burning and labeling a DVD, and addressing the package):
  
Coney Island Film Festival
  
UnderSHORTS Film Festival (Chicago)
  
Chicago Underground Film Festival
  
Chicago International REEL Shorts Festival
  
Rooftop Films (NYC)

And then send copies of DWG (along with press kits) for review to Film Threat, Microcinemascene, and The Ballroom Review.

\*whew\*

Tomorrow&#8230;the post office!
