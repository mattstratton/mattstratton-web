I&#8217;m trying to design the ultimate &#8220;ease of use&#8221; system to accomodate playing music in the new place. Here&#8217;s the background of what we&#8217;ve got:

Matt &#8211; 30+ GB iTunes library on his Mac. Approx 4 GB of iTMS protected AAC files; the rest is all MP3. iPod Nano. Very few audio CDs (all have been ripped to library)

Carrie &#8211; relatively small iTunes library on her Windows PC. A few iTMS protected songs. iPod Mini. A few CDs.

Carrie&#8217;s computer will be in our guest room, and mine will be in the office. I want to figure out a solution to allow music playback in at least the living room, and potentially in the backyard. I considered the Airport Express (since it&#8217;s the only solution that will allow the playback of the iTMS stuff), but I hate that I won&#8217;t be able to switch songs, etc, from anywhere but the computer. I am really intrigued by the Slim Devices [Squeezebox][1], but then I can&#8217;t play any iTMS stuff. And since iTMS is where I buy almost all of my music from these days, that&#8217;s kind of a factor.

Thoughts? Suggestions?
