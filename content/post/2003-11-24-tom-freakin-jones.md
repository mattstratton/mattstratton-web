So I just got home from the <a href="https://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/singerUnid/30B3C8E8321DEB4248256B72002EA36F" target="_new">Tom Jones</a> show.

Man, that was really fun. For a 63 year old guy, he looks great and really can move.

It&#8217;s interesting how much of the &#8220;Tom Jones&#8221; stuff has become cliche; there literally were dozens of pairs of women&#8217;s underwear thrown on stage. I think it&#8217;s become more of a &#8220;tradition&#8221; than being done for the original reason, you know? But he really plays with it&#8230;if they throw it and he catches it, he wipes his brow and chest with it, and throws it back.

One woman threw a pair up there&#8230;he pretended to smell it and said &#8220;I think I know this woman!&#8221; That made me laugh.

It was to see all the middle-aged women swooning though. The place was PACKED (sold out crowd at HOB) and everyone was just in a good-time mode.

I think this is cool:

_A long friendship with Elvis Presley was built on mutual respect and admiration. Elvis would warm up his voice to Delilah before his own performances, and when Green Green Grass of Home hit for Tom in 1966, Elvis would call radio stations repeatedly to request the song._
