Shooting this weekend for &#8220;Inventing: Music&#8221;.

I&#8217;ve discovered that I need to get better at summarizing. People ask me what DWG or I:M are about, and I either need to take five minutes to explain it, or I just say &#8220;It&#8217;s about [purity][1].&#8221;

I&#8217;m a little nervous about this shoot. But I think it&#8217;s all gonna work out jeeeeessst fahn&#8230;
