I have to be downtown until noon on Saturday for an ACS thing, but I&#8217;ll be hightailing it to Ribfest right after to catch the last half of the Hoyle Brothers. I think you all should come out too. Because ribs rule and so does honky-tonk. I also will be there later in the evening for Bobby Bare, Jr.
