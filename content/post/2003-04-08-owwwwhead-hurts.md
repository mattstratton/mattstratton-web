So last night was a _bad_ idea.

Went to Fizz to wish Shermu and Em Bee congratulamations on their engagement. Was only going to hang out long enough to do that, and then catch a ride home with C and S around 11.

Well, three cocktails, one beer, and three shots later, I&#8217;m at the White Castle drive-thru with Backstreet and Jayno at 2:30 AM.

I got to sleep about 3:15 and woke up at 6. Ouch.

But the good news is I&#8217;m getting a new POS tonight, so hopefully no more bus, and that will buy me an extra two hours of sleep a day!
