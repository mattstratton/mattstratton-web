Seriously, what the fuck is up with that guy? Half the shit in his journal is just crap he ganked from [jwz][1]. And I got news for you, Mister Tee Dee Jay &#8211; just because you have a three-letter LJ id, that doesn&#8217;t make you Jamie Zawinsky. Did \*you\* ever hard-code a shortcut to your homepage in Netscape Navigator? I didn&#8217;t think so.

Plus, I&#8217;m sick of all the smart broads on my friends list drooling over this guy. I keep slipping in the puddles.
