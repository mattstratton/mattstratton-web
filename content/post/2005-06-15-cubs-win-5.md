Man, last night was a blowout game.

Cubs defeated the Marlins 14-0. That means that the last two games I have attended, the Cubs scored 14 runs in each.

It was a true blowout. No Marlin ever made it past 2nd base. Mitre only had three strikeouts &#8211; 18 of the outs were ground balls into the infield, including two double plays. Only three plays were made by Cub outfielders.

Four Cub homers &#8211; two for Ramirez, one each for Barrett and Lee.
