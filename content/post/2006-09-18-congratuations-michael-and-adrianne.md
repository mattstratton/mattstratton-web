Yesterday, two pretty awesome people got married. 

And I was lucky enough to be there to witness it.

Our dear friends Michael and Adrianne were married at Cafe Brauer on Sunday, Sep 17, 2007. The whole shebang started with a short and sweet (heavy on the sweet) ceremony at 10 AM, followed by cocktails, and then a delicious brunch. 

Music and dancing (and Legos) was capped off with the bride and groom heading off in a horse-drawn carriage. 

It was a great wedding. Being in the process of planning a wedding myself, I find that when I attend these things, I&#8217;m pretty critical. But there wasn&#8217;t a single thing at this wedding that I didn&#8217;t think was dead-on perfect. The only thing that I was disappointed in was how quickly the whole thing went &#8211; I was having such a good time, it was very sad when 2 PM rolled around and everyone packed up to leave.

The food &#8211; great. The decorations and favors? Adorable and appropriate. The music was fantastic. And the venue could not be beat.

It was really a touching moment to be a part of. I&#8217;ve only known Michael for a few years, and Adrianne is someone I&#8217;ve only really gotten to know recently. But they are both really true and genunine people, who are always a joy to be around. Michael is a quiet and deep man who I am proud to know. 

And, as always, I was honored to be invited to share in a life-changing event such as a wedding. 

Thank you, Michael and Adrianne, for letting me be a part of such a special day in your new lives.
