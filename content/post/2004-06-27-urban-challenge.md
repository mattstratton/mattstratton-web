So two of my friends entered the <a href="http://www.urbanchallenge.com" target="_blank">Urban Challenge</a> today. They asked me to be their &#8220;headquarters&#8221; (which basically meant they called me all day to have me look stuff up on the internet and figure out clues, plus help them figure out how to get places on the CTA).

Well, they came in 5th place! Which means we&#8217;re all going to Miami in November for the finals to try to win $50,000.

How exciting!
