Last week, my co-worker says &#8220;this guy in my building is selling a 36&#8243; sony wega HD tv for $500&#8221;. (my friend has the exact same TV; it&#8217;s a $2000+ tv new) We notice that he&#8217;s had it listed for over a month. I figure the guy is desparate to unload it, so we think &#8220;hey, let&#8217;s see if we can whittle him down to $400&#8221;.

So I email him, and ask if it is still available. It is

We arrange to go look at it today

You know why he&#8217;s in such a hurry to unload it?

He&#8217;s just recently been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig&#8217;s disease and he bought a huge DLP TV, since he doesn&#8217;t have much time left to live. Now he just wants the old Sony out of the way of his wheelchair.

I can&#8217;t exactly try to beat him up on the price, since I don&#8217;t really want to go to hell.

I just seriously couldn&#8217;t beleive it.We&#8217;re all set to shake this dude down and he&#8217;s DYING.

My friend told me I was a pussy for not trying to get a better deal. I kept waiting for him to be like Walter in _The Big Lebowski_ and accuse the guy of faking.

Edit: I did buy the TV for $500.
