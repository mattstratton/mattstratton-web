I&#8217;ll post more later &#8211; busy at work right now. Lots of updates, but here are the highlights:

* Christmas was cool. Lots of family, lots of Wii.
  
* NYE was spent Up North with Brian and Angie. We went skiing. Dogs are hilarious.
  
* Crashed the car into a guardrail in Indiana on the way home. Nobody was hurt, no other cars involved, but the car had to be towed. Sad
