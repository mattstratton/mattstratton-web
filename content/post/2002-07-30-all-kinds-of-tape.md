Cherie and I were discussing the many kinds of tape today. I thought it was pretty funny. Seems like it&#8217;d be easier if everything was simple&#8230;

Cherie: what is gaff tape?
  
Mugsy: gaffer&#8217;s tape
  
Cherie: ich weiss es nicht&#8230;?
  
Mugsy: the black tape (looks like electrical tape) used to tape cords, and anything else, on a movie set
  
Cherie: oh
  
Cherie: it&#8217;s not called electrical tape?
  
Mugsy: electrical tape is slightly different
  
Cherie: how so?
  
Mugsy: it&#8217;s a lot more like cloth, and rips very easily (like a piece of cloth would, or duct tape does)
  
Cherie: ok
  
Cherie: so like that blue tape that is kinda like masking tape
  
Cherie: ??
  
Mugsy: that&#8217;s painting tape
  
Cherie: oh
  
Mugsy: it&#8217;s paper. gaff is cloth.
  
Cherie: so like hockey stick wrapping tape?
