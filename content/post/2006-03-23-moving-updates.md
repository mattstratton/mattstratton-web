So tomorrow is the Big Move Day.

Carrie and I are \*mostly\* ready. I still have a bunch of crap that I&#8217;ll end up having to move after Friday, probably. But the big stuff is ready to go.

Carrie and I have been moving boxes all week. We have moved almost all of our boxes; there are maybe 5-6 boxes for the movers to move in addition to the furniture.

Hopefully everything will go quickly tomorrow. They really don&#8217;t have much to move from my house, and not a terrible lot from Carrie&#8217;s. But it&#8217;ll be nice to not have to move the heavy furniture and TV ourselves, that&#8217;s for sure.
