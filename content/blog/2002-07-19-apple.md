Actually, if you want to know what annoys me the most about the announcements of iTools going to a pay service, or the $129 price tag for Jaguar, it&#8217;s that MY FREAKIN&#8217; FRIENDS PAGE IS HUGE AND LONG WITH THE HUNDRED BAZILLION POSTS IN ALL THE MACINTOSH COMMUNITIES.

OK.

That&#8217;s all.

For the record &#8211; I don&#8217;t use iTools, so I don&#8217;t care about that, and I will most likely pay the $129 for the Jaguar upgrade, because, hey, if I wanted free shit, I&#8217;d be a Linux/Open Source zealot and not a productive member of society.
