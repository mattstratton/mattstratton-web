&#8230;of the weekend.

It was pretty good. It was also (as I told Larry last night) the exact perfect thing I am trying to accomplish with my weekend trips to NY.

It was just a normal weekend (obviously, Zoe&#8217;s party on Saturday night is not a &#8220;regular&#8221; thing) &#8211; went to a bar, hung out and ate some food, ran errands, and played poker.

There&nbsp; was a marked lack of pomp and circumstance, and this was good. Plus, I got to go see a subway museum. That was neat.

On another note, I found it interesting that someone who made a big deal out of the fact that I apparently am supposed to always apprise this person of my whereabouts and travel plans to New York never returned my phone call all weekend, despite the fact that we were supposed to have plans on Sunday. So again, a good chance to have a &#8220;regular&#8221; weekend for me, but in NYC &#8211; being stood up. Hehehe.

Oh, and on the food tip &#8211; Eli was right (it pains me to say it) but sushi is so much better there. And whatever Thai place Amanda and I went to on Friday night was soo very yummy.

And I took the subway&nbsp; by myself on Sunday. Well, almost by myself; I had to call Amanda, but I pretty much knew where I was going&#8230;sort of.

I need to get myself a subway book or website or something &#8211; there&#8217;s a lot more involved in public transit over there than I am used to, and I don&#8217;t want to be a big tourist.
