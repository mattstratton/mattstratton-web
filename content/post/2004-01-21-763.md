The editor of DWG (Andrew) just sent me this email (after viewing the <a href="http://dancingwithgaia.com/teaser" target="_new">DWG trailer</a>):

_We&#8217;ll trick the general public to seeing this thing yet. Though our first
  
attempt: writing &#8220;dancing with&#8221; very tiny and accidentally writing
  
Gigli instead, didn&#8217;t go over too well and ruined a couple two, three
  
careers._
