Just got this email:

> All,  
> Bob* would like to have a 15 minutes discussion regarding organizational changes.&nbsp; **Please** make every effort to attend.

Just the other day, Fat Johnny mentioned that it&#8217;s been a long time since we&#8217;ve had a big re-org. We shall see what happens five minutes from now. 

Additionally, they just changed everyone&#8217;s titles a few weeks ago &#8211; I went from &#8220;Distributed Computing Engineer Senior I&#8221; to &#8220;Engineer&#8221;. The other title that was possible for me was &#8220;Engineering Lead&#8221;. Everyone on my team but me is a &#8220;Lead&#8221; &#8211; I am the only implementation guy that is an &#8220;engineer&#8221;. No, wait, there&#8217;s one other guy too.

<font size="1">* &#8211; My boss&#8217;s boss&#8217;s boss.</font>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">UPDATE </span>&#8211; basically, they cut a bunch of positions in our larger organization. Only two people in my org were laid off, and I only know one of them (the other I have no idea who she is). In a nutshell, my job is safe, and they said they are not forseeing any cuts in the next few months.
