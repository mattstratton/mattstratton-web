Wow, what a busy few days this has been.

Saturday, Dallas and I worked all day on _Inventing: Music_. Finished up the day around 5 PM with a pretty decent cut of the film. I worked a little bit of movie magic in FCP by subbing in alternate audio to cover a line flub by an actor; it looks pretty clean, actually. Dallas said he was going to buy me a pizza. He never did.

After we wrapped up, we went to see Partytom&#8217;s band play. A pretty funny guy &#8220;opened&#8221; for him. Plus, the Beeyachskis played &#8220;Euro Trash Girl&#8221;, which made me happy. Dallas and I left the bar at midnight, because we knew we had to get up early the next day. Of course, we ended up staying up until three A.M. brainstorming and writing for the next short, _Inventing: Stephen_. I&#8217;m really happy with the ideas we have for it; it&#8217;ll be a departure for us (it&#8217;s not a comedy), and Dallas is going to direct it. I hope he gets the AD we want for him.

Sunday we headed to Superior St. to work on _[Dancing With Gaia][1]_. Did sync and polish on the two green room scenes, and then put together a sub-master to dump to VHS for the guy doing our titling. Afterwards, we headed to Tom and Kim&#8217;s house, where Lisa, Jodie, Kitty, Kim, and Tom watched the print. I was glad that they laughed at things. And Lisa got involved with one of the characters. I haven&#8217;t watched DWG as a unit in so long; it made me happy to see there&#8217;s a story there. It&#8217;s not complete, and there&#8217;s still work to do, but I think that we&#8217;ll end with a film I&#8217;m proud of.

Monday was spent doing final editing on I:M. We were going to work until about 9 PM, then go to Fizz to hang out with the kids. Well, we didn&#8217;t finish up the polish edit until 10:30 PM. So we watched some TV, and the started doing the audio sweetening around midnight; I finished it at 5 AM.

Tuesday was the big party. Got the place all cleaned up and lots of food prepared! At the party, [CTodd][2] and I poured drinks until midnight, after which we dedicated ourselves to drinking. Apparently, I kissed a lot of people. LIke a LOT. But it was mostly enjoyable.

Yesterday was cleanup day and watch movies. We sat around watching _State and Main_ and _Hackers_, and then played Trivial Pursuit. Jayno and I came from behind and won the game. It was fun.
