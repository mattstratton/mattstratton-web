Had this IM conversation with Gaga Girl #2&#8230;.

**Gaga Girl #2:** and then we will meet hot people
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** that want to date us
  
**Mugsy:**: why will we need to meet hot people? we are already hot
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** and who hold up crossing guard signs that say, &#8220;GO FOR IT, DAMMIT!&#8221;
  
**Mugsy:**: we should make those signs
  
**Mugsy:**: and sell them online
  
**Mugsy:**: for big bucks
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** how cool would that be
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** so one side would say that, and the other side would be a stop sign
  
**Mugsy:**: if you had a sign like that would you use it?
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** no
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** it would have to be littler
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** so it could fit neatly into a purse
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** or something
  
**Mugsy:**: well that&#8217;s a design issue
  
**Mugsy:**: I&#8217;m a concept guy
  
**Mugsy:**: I have no time for your &#8220;details&#8221; and &#8220;feasibility&#8221;
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** i still wouldn&#8217;t use it though
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** cuz how do you know if the other person is deciding whether or not to go for it???
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** see, then it all starts over again
  
**Mugsy:**: ah, there&#8217;s the flaw in the plan&#8230;
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** cuz if you knew someone was pondering, you could help them out
  
**Gaga Girl #2:** it&#8217;s the fact that neither person knows what the other person is doing
