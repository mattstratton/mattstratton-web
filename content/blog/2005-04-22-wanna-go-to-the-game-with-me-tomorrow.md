I have a pair of seats for the Cubs/Pirates game at Wrigley tomorrow.

I was going to go with my friend Darlyn, but it&#8217;s supposed to be ass-cold, plus maybe snowy/rainy. Given that Darlyn is Miami-bred, she is scared of such things. So if any of you would like to come with me instead, please let me know ASAP.
