So Fizz Girl came to the poker game last weekend. I felt bad because we never played at the same table, and I was busy being Mr. Hosting Guy. But I guess she had fun. She stayed around for quite a while and played in the side games. And apparently she made friends, because she&#8217;s going to be joining Troy, Rak, and I dealing at a casino night thing next Monday night. Crazy!

(][1] and Jen are doing it too)

It&#8217;s okay though&#8230;I&#8217;m not upset or worried; I just always worry at things like that game when there is someone there who doesn&#8217;t really know anyone else and I don&#8217;t have the ability to really shepard them around.
