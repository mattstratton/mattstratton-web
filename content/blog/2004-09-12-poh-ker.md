Just got home from the Hold &#8216;Em tournament.

Special thanks to and (who, as promised, wore something fantastically low-cut) for being rockstar dealers.

It was the first tournament I&#8217;ve held where I placed in the money. I came in 4th out of 19 players. It was a fun and asshole-free night of cards. And finished about two hours earlier than our usual end time!
