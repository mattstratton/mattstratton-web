Here&#8217;s &#8216;s second stab at being nice&#8230;

&#8220;Mugsy is soooooooo nice! You \*have\* to date him! I mean, come on! He&#8217;s like funny and smart and you could like be in one of his movies. And he&#8217;d probably buy you flowers and be nice to your dog and he&#8217;d really charm your mom. And if you date him, you can get your very own icon on WindyHop, and he won&#8217;t even make you put out for it! Who can ask for anything more?&#8221;&#8211;Shana Worel, Mugsy&#8217;s biggest fan! But don&#8217;t worry, he&#8217;s just a friend, so you don&#8217;t have to worry when you date him!

Help!
