**1. How are you planning to spend the summer?**
  
Hopefully starting my new job&#8230;but I know I&#8217;ll also be working on authoring the DVD for [Dancing With Gaia][1], editing _Inventing: Stephen_, and hopefully be working on writing _Inventing: Green_. Supposedly going to be shooting a music video for this guy, as well. Besides that, lots of cooking out, and I&#8217;m going to Denver for a weekend the end of August.

**2. What was your first summer job?**
  
I was a camp counselor at Cub Scout Day Camp. Best job I ever had. It was my summer job all through high school as well, even when I worked a &#8220;real&#8221; summer job at the paint store.

**3. If you could go anywhere this summer, where would you go?**
  
Australia, baby. I&#8217;ve always wanted to go.

**4. What was your worst vacation ever?**
  
Hmm&#8230;off the top of my head, it would be a couple summers ago&#8230;I went to Las Vegas with a girl I was dating&#8230;but apparently she had decided we weren&#8217;t dating anymore, and didn&#8217;t tell me&#8230;we had a pretty piss-poor time there (she was a day person, and I was up at night), and we didn&#8217;t speak at all on the plane ride home.

**5. What was your best vacation ever?**
  
That&#8217;s a tough one. Probably if you combine my last three trips to Vegas into one, that would be the best vacation ever.
