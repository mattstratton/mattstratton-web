So I went out with Gaga Girl #2 last night.

I guess I really shouldn&#8217;t say we &#8220;went out&#8221;; we went to see _Chicago_ and then had dinner with Sarah and Chris. Nothing transpired that made it any different than if I&#8217;d gone to the movies with Tracy or with Dallas.

We chatted a lot though. That was nice. She&#8217;s looking at grad schools for next year, and only one of the three is in Chicago. She just got accepted there, but it&#8217;s her last choice. So logically, I shouldn&#8217;t pursue anything with her, because I really \*do\* like her, and it&#8217;d be better to just be friends than have something superficial.

Why do I end up attracted to the girls who are inaccessible?
