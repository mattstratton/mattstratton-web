I&#8217;m heading out on vacation starting today, my little kiddies&#8230;

I&#8217;ll be in Hot-lanna until next Monday (July 8), then I come home for a few days, and truck out to NYC from Thursday (July 11) to Monday (July 15).

Atlanta is gonna be a fun week of hanging with cute suthin&#8217; gals, drinkin&#8217; sweet tea, and doing some writing. NYC will be a weekend of improv and lounging&#8230;good times to be had by all!

Anyway, chances are I will not be online much over the next week, so I&#8217;ll miss you all&#8230;check out &#8216;s new [haircut][1]! (I guess my journal is all about promoting girls&#8217; haircuts&#8230;I can think of worse things).
