Man, that was a lot of fun tonight. I think I actually helped them. We did a lot of object work, which is way out of the comfort zone for this group. Actually, it was less small object work (which they are good at) but a lot more &#8220;where&#8221; object work. Stuff that seems so simple, like keeping track of a table&#8230;but things that we &#8220;forget&#8221; about as we progress. Just like in lindy hop, where it can be really good to go back to basics, the same is true of improv. We do these exercises in Level 1, but when we re-visit them as experienced improvisors, we see them in a different light.

I wish I could see their show on Saturday just to see how much of tonight&#8217;s stuff &#8220;stuck&#8221;. I hope they ask me back again. And I think I really need to go take some classes again. I miss this shit.
