So I met someone amazing this weekend.

It&#8217;s very odd. We&#8217;d talked before, but this weekend was the first time we met in person. And it was truly amazing how comfortable I felt with her.

I&#8217;m a rational kind of guy. I like to understand things. I don&#8217;t understand this. And that&#8217;s pretty cool, but also really unnerving for my logical, analytical mind. Every time I try to take this feeling out and study it, it slips out of my grasp. I can only see it in peripheral vision or something.

She lives almost 1,000 miles away. That&#8217;s very sad to me. But luckily, airplanes are very fast.

Usually, I&#8217;m very private. I don&#8217;t like talking much about personal things. For example, if someone asked me &#8220;How was your date last night?&#8221; I am usually non-committal with a &#8220;It was okay&#8221; no matter what. But for some reason, I am finding myself wanting to tell EVERYONE about her.

She&#8217;ll be here in two weeks. It seems like Sunday was forever ago.
