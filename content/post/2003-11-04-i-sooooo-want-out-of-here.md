You know, it really sucks.

I like my job, usually. I love working in our downtown office, and the people I work with down here are great.

My boss is an ass though. He never calls me back, never replies to emails, and generally busts my balls about stuff I have under control (stuff like asking for status on something when I ALREADY EMAILED HIM ABOUT IT).

My boss basically told one of the clients I would be in Glenview at 7 pm on Friday to help him. So I called my boss and said, &#8220;So I got a call from R\___ P\____ about helping him rack a server on Friday night.&#8221;

My boss said &#8220;yup&#8221;.

I said &#8220;you expect me to do this?&#8221;

He said &#8220;No, he will do the work, I just need someone there to supervise, I don&#8217;t want him in the data center alone&#8221;

I said &#8220;uh, okay, I was just kind of blindsided by the Friday night thing&#8221;

He said &#8220;yeah, we all get that&#8221; and hung up.

I hate how he did it. If he&#8217;d ASKED, I would have totally done it. I would have bitched, because it&#8217;s a pain, but would have done it.

But the assumption&#8230;that is treating your people like resources, and not like people

And it&#8217;s very typical of his attitude since taking over.
