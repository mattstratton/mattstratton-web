Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I am so into Apple that it hurts, and I love the Mac, especially OS X.

But some of these fanboys suck down the Cupertino Kool-Aid so thoroughly that I get a contact Reality Distortion Field just by sharing TCP packets with them.

At the end of the day, it&#8217;s a fucking computer. It&#8217;s not a way of life. It&#8217;s not a religion. And unless you&#8217;re trying to fuck SwingKitten, using a Mac isn&#8217;t going to help your sex life. And even then, you&#8217;d better be a thin hipster guy with glasses, or even a prototype G5 Powerbook won&#8217;t get you to second base.

About the only good thing about the Mac is that it doesn&#8217;t run Windows. Plus, it&#8217;s pretty. Plus, it&#8217;s the best thing ever on the entire planet. Plus, Steve Jobs sweats much less profusely than Steve Ballmer.
