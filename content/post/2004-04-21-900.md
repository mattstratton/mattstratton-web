**Weird Al Honors Parents&#8217; Memory With
  
&#8216;Tears In Heaven&#8217; Parody**
  
FALLBROOK, CAâ€”Zany, mourning entertainer &#8220;Weird Al&#8221; Yankovic has parodied Eric Clapton&#8217;s eulogy song &#8220;Tears In Heaven&#8221; in loving tribute to his parents, who recently died of carbon-monoxide poisoning in their San Diego home, a spokesman for Yankovic said Monday. &#8220;Al&#8217;s hurting deeply right now, and this is his way of honoring Nick and Mary,&#8221; Karl Tuft said of the song in which a subdued Yankovic sings, &#8220;First you lit some flames / Then the smoke stopped your breathin&#8217; / Carbon mono&#8217;s th&#8217;way you went&#8230; / Up to heaven&#8221; over a somber, minor-key accordion melody. Tuft added that the best way for Yankovic to give voice to his pain and loss was by altering the voice of Clapton&#8217;s pain and loss.
