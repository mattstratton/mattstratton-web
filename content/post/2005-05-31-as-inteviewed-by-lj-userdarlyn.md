_1. Whose show are you most likely to appear on Jerry Springer or Oprah? And what would that episode be titled?_

Years ago, my friend Chris and his girlfriend and I always wanted to &#8220;punk&#8221; Springer (this idea predates the term &#8220;punked&#8221;), and make up some hokey story about how she got pregnant and kept the kid in a laundy basket or something.

_2. What is your favorite food? (cuisine and a specific meal).
  
_ 
  
I love good sushi, but I think at the end of the day, my favorite food is a really, REALLY good steak dinner. Like the one I had in Atlantic City on Saturday night. Mmmm&#8230;porterhouse.

_3. How did you get into moviemaking?
  
_ 
  
I studied theatre in college, but always wanted to make movies. I putzed around with video in high school, but then put those toys away until 2001. Then, while standing outside on my balcony smoking cigarettes and drinking beers, Dallas and I thought &#8220;hey, why don&#8217;t we try to make a movie?&#8221;

_4. Why is your icon you kissing the cheek of a guy, instead of me kissing your cheek on New Year&#8217;s?
  
_ 
  
Because I look terrible in that picture. Although nobody ever notices that I&#8217;m even IN that picture, due to the immensely hot chick sharing it with me.

_5. OUt of your many awesome qualities, which do you consider the most awesome quality or talent?_

I think it&#8217;s my ability to listen to anyone. Well, anyone who doesn&#8217;t annoy me. I&#8217;m very good at listening to people who I care about, and seeing a &#8220;big picture&#8221; view. At least that&#8217;s what they tell me.
