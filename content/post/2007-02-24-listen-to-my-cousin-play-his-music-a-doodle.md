My cousin David (who is currently attending Oberlin) is some kind of magical violin genius. Anyway, I just got this email from my aunt, so if you dig on the stringy strings, you might want to check this out.

_Through this coming Friday, you can hear David performing Sarasate’s Zigeunerweisen via the Internet. There is a weekly Danish radio program called “Folk & Musik” that airs every Saturday morning, and you can always hear the latest broadcast at: <a href="https://www.dr.dk/P2/folkogmusik/20051130134023.htm" target="_blank">https://www.dr.dk/P2/folkogmusik/20051130134023.htm</a> by selecting ”Senest Folk & Musik” (under the section called “Lyt til P2” at the right).</p> 

This broadcast is from a concert of the finalist from a competition here in Denmark. The program today included half of the finalists &#8211; David is the second of the four to perform.

Besides David there is a 16 year old bassoonist (one of Daniel’s buddies from Tivoligard, and member of his newly started wind quintet), a 14-15 year old cellist (a friend of ours – his brother is a violinist and one of David’s good buddies – and they have an American father), and a 19-20 year old trumpetist.

I still cannot believe that David chose to play the Sarastate. When he performed for the actual competition a couple of hours before, he played something completely different (Carl Nielsen’s Violin Concerto – introduction only, because they were restricted to a short time) – and he had not performed the Sarasate since last summer. He used something like 2 x 20 minutes to try to get it pulled back to shape.

Anyway, if you’re interested, go to the program and scroll to around ¼ of the way through once it gets going. He comes on just after the bassoon finishes.</em>

For the record, &#8220;Daniel&#8221; is my other cousin (David&#8217;s younger brother) who is also super musically talented.
