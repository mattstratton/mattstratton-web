My [Bloginality][1] is [ENFP][2]!!!

**You are an ENFP!**
  
As an ENFP, you are Extraverted, iNtuative, Feeling , Perceiving.
  
This makes your primary focus on Extraverted Intuition with Introverted Feeling.

This is defined as a **NF** personality, which is part of Carl Jung&#8217;s Idealist (Identity Seeking) type, and more specifically the <u>Champions</u> or Inspirer.

As a weblogger, you may not be consistant in posts. Although, if you find a specific focus on their journal or a very flexible manner of writing, it may be more fufilling. Because you are warm and see so many posibilities in life, you may inspire others to follow in your footsteps with a journal.

&#8212;

Well, the quiz for this was all of five questions or something&#8230;so who knows how accurate. Do you guys think it descibes my blogging accurately?
