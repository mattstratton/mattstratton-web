Some of you know, but about a week ago I started trying to be healthier. Based upon Tosh&#8217;s suggestion, I signed up with [Calorie King][1] and have been tracking my food intake and exercise.

So far, it&#8217;s going well. I didn&#8217;t actually weigh myself until Friday (when we bought a scale), and discovered that I weighed in on Friday about two pounds less than what I had thought I started at. Pretty good, I thought.

Then, I weighed myself without my clothes, and found that I was even lighter. Go figure.

Based upon my now accurate tracking, though, I have lost five pounds since Friday. I chalk it up to eating better, plus I bought a bike yesterday and have been enjoying riding it so far. Carrie and I rode to Tracy&#8217;s house yesterday, which was about five miles round trip (no big deal), and we took an hour-long ride this morning down to the lake, which (according to the [gmaps thingerdoodle][2]) was about 8 1/2 miles.

Fun!
