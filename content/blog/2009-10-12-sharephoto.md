Are you going to the <a href="https://www.mssharepointconference.com" target="_blank">SharePoint Conference</a> in Las Vegas next week? Do you dig photography (or just walking around Las Vegas with some cool fellow SharePoint folks)? Since both of those things apply (in my case), in conjunction with <a href="https://twitter.com/philoking" target="_blank">@philoking</a> I&#8217;m organizing **SharePhoto** &#8211; the unofficial SharePoint Conference Photowalk.

If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the concept of a photowalk (also known as a photostroll), it&#8217;s just what the name applies. As a group, we&#8217;ll be walking around the Vegas Strip, cameras in hand, taking pictures of things that strike our fancy. And along the way, we&#8217;ll have a great time and maybe share some photo tips with each other.

**The Gory Details**

The photowalk will kick off at **8:30 PM on Wednesday, October 21, 2009**. We&#8217;ll meet at the lobby of the <a href="https://www.mgmgrand.com" target="_blank">MGM Grand</a> hotel (so that folks who are participating in #ShareSushi can join us). Follow me on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/mattstratton" target="_blank">@mattstratton</a>) for updates as we progress along the walk, in case you can&#8217;t meet us at the kickoff.

I&#8217;m still working out the exact route and stops along the way (so keep an eye on this page for updates), but we&#8217;ll try to hit some of the more interesting photo opportunities as we make our way north along the Strip. If the mood strikes us, maybe we&#8217;ll jump in some cabs and head downtown to Fremont Street, which is a great place for some awesome shots.

We&#8217;ll probably finish up around 11:30 PM or so, but it will depend on how everyone is feeling &#8211; so it&#8217;s not a &#8220;hard stop&#8221;. The important things to make sure you bring with you are comfortable walking shoes and clothing (don&#8217;t forget, it gets a little chilly at night in Vegas), and, of course, your camera. Heck, even if you don&#8217;t have a camera, you can feel free to join is, as it should be fun regardless. I also highly recommend bringing a tripod (if you have one), since night photography usually means longer shutter speeds, which means hand-holding is not a good idea.

If you&#8217;d like to join us, please head over to the RSVP page here &#8211; <a href="https://twtvite.com/8lok8y" target="_blank">https://twtvite.com/8lok8y</a>. If you don&#8217;t have a Twitter account, you can always RSVP by leaving a comment on this blog post, and I&#8217;ll add you to the list. If you have any questions or ideas for SharePhoto, please leave a comment here as well. Looking forward to seeing you all at SPC09!
