This past Saturday, I attended my first ever &#8220;tweetup&#8221; with some Chicago-area bloggers. In addition to being hilarious and personable in 3D, these folks have some entertaining and educational blogs. And here they are!

<a href="http://freeandflawed.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Free and Flawed</strong></a> &#8211; Covering topics including social media, dating within the blogosphere, and random hilarity, there&#8217;s nothing I don&#8217;t like about this blog. Plus, Jenn and I already share a special bond since we walked to the ATM together on Saturday night.

<a href="http://www.mominreallife.com/" target="_blank"><strong>I&#8217;m a Mom in Real Life</strong></a> &#8211; It probably goes without saying that I am not the target demo for most &#8220;mommy blogs&#8221;. It also probably goes without saying that Rachel will punch my lights out for referring to her as a &#8220;mommy blogger&#8221;. That being said, you really should check her blog out. She&#8217;s absolutely hilarious on [Twitter][1], and this same humor and panache is present in her blog. Plus, her husband is cool and I was already able to help him out by confirming his theory on &#8220;neck beards&#8221; to his wife.

<a href="http://dshan.me/blog" target="_blank"><strong>dshan</strong></a> &#8211; Derek and I had a great conversation about business uses for social media on Saturday, plus we shared stories of strange experiences we&#8217;d had on the street in Wicker Park (mine involved a parking meter and Flash Taco&#8230;his was a little more racy). He also apparently posts a <a href="http://dshan.me/blog/category/music/twenty-nine" target="_blank">monthly mixtape</a> that is chock-full of musical goodness. Who doesn&#8217;t like musical goodness?

<a href="http://www.thiswench.com/" target="_blank"><strong>WENCH</strong></a> &#8211; I&#8217;m not actually sure of the proper capitalization for this blog title, but I suppose it might be up for interpretation. In addition to being full of laughs in person, Rini&#8217;s blog is refreshing, eye-opening, and frank. And if you like things that are pink, you should read it.

<a href="http://dillydallylollygagger.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Blah Blah Blah</strong></a> &#8211; Randomness abounds in the blogosphere, and Molly&#8217;s blog is no exception. Notice that I do not consider &#8220;randomness&#8221; to be a negative thing &#8211; it just means that I&#8217;m too dumb to be able to describe it properly . If you like pictures of trees, this just might be the blog for you. I suppose you don&#8217;t have to be obsessed with pictures of trees, but if you are afraid of trees, then maybe you should steer clear. Incidentally, she has the best URL ever.

<a href="http://fluidmotiongirl.blogspot.com" target="_blank"><strong>Fluid Motion</strong></a> &#8211; This is Hallie&#8217;s blog, and I&#8217;ve only started reading it today, so I can&#8217;t say much about it. But I can say that all night on Saturday, I kept calling her the wrong name. She introduced herself to me with Molly, so at first I thought her name was &#8220;Holly&#8221; &#8211; in fact, I said &#8220;Ah, that will be easy to remember, because of Molly&#8217;s name&#8221;, which explains why she gave me such a weird look. She later corrected me. Of course, shortly thereafter, I called her &#8220;Haley&#8221;. I can&#8217;t imagine that I made a very good impression.
