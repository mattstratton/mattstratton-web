So I&#8217;m STILL looking for someone to take the second ticket for tomorrow&#8217;s Cubs game with me. Everyone seems to be busy or not willing to play hooky from work. Grr.

I kind of wish I could get to Craigslist from work; I almost want to post something offering the ticket (for what I paid) to a fellow Cubs fan who wants to go to the game.

ETA &#8211; I just discovered that Craiglist totally works on my BlackBerry&#8230;and randomly enough, I saw someone post in the &#8220;Strictly Platonic&#8221; offering up a free ticket for tomorrow&#8217;s game&#8230;of course, it was a woman looking for a guy to go to the game with&#8230;somehow I think she&#8217;d get a lot more replies than I would with my &#8220;I&#8217;m a dude, and by the way, the ticket is not free&#8221;. That being said, someone write me a Craiglist ad to solicit out the ticket (price $30 OBO). kthx
