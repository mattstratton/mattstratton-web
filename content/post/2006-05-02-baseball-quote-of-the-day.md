A Yankee fan&#8217;s [response][1] to Red Sox faithful:

> I&#8217;d love to have some sort of snappy thing to say about Johnny Damon getting booed, but I don&#8217;t. From a Yankee fan&#8217;s perspective, I was actually hoping he&#8217;d get at least SOME cheers. Alas, he didn&#8217;t. The fans holding up &#8220;Judas Damon&#8221; posters and &#8220;Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye&#8221; posters are fucking idiots, and if they ever decide to go look for a new job that pays them better, and their old job declines to match the new job&#8217;s offer so they take the new job instead, I will go to their cubicle/gas station/hot dog stand and boo them in turn. 

I love it. I mean, I realize that Johnny Damon returning to Fenway is (apparently) the BIGGEST FUCKING DEAL IN ALL OF MAJOR LEAGUE HISTORY OH NOES1!!11!!11, but I do have to agree that if you like a player, you like the player. Johnny Damon didn&#8217;t personally go and fuck all of those Red Sox fans up the ass, and he (probably) didn&#8217;t sleep with their sisters.

Probably.
