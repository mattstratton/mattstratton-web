Shut up, , I&#8217;m going to whine and you&#8217;re going to like it.

It&#8217;s time for my annual &#8220;none of my friends think I&#8217;m good enough for their single lady friends&#8221; complaint.

To my friends &#8211; please realize that I am quite aware that you don&#8217;t consider me a potential date for your girlfriends. I&#8217;m not stupid. I see how you are all happy to &#8220;arrange&#8221; for other male friends of yours to meet up with these girls &#8211; men who are better looking than I am, more successful, whatever. Just so you know, I&#8217;m not stupid, and I&#8217;m not blind.

Then end.
