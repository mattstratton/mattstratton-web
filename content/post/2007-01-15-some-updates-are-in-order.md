I feel like I haven&#8217;t updated my LJ in forever. That&#8217;s probably because I haven&#8217;t.

I&#8217;m sure there are loads and loads of things to share. But I&#8217;m just going to quickly recap the weekend &#8211; or, as Carrie dubbed it, an Adventure in Three Parts.

Part 1 &#8211; Wedding Tastings:
  
On Saturday, Carrie and I dropped Scout off at [Stay][1] (a new dog hotel that clued us into). The place is friggin&#8217; sweet as all hell. Huge play area, super clean, and super nice staff. And since it was our first day there, it was free.

After dropping off Scout, Carrie&#8217;s parents picked us up and we headed down to the House of Fine Chocolates for the wedding cake tasting. We settled upon a couple yummy choices. And even though we were right next door to The Bagel, we held onto our appetites for the trip downtown to the Chicago City Centre.

Let me just tell you &#8211; all of this food tasting is about the most awesome thing about getting married. We also had a &#8220;tasting&#8221; at Wishbone on Wednesday for our rehearsal dinner &#8211; we tried SEVENTEEN things. We literally rolled out of there.

But back to the subject at hand &#8211; we quickly settled upon our appetizers and entrees, included a vegetarian option. We&#8217;ll be serving both filet and salmon for everyone, so no need to deal with reply cards &#8211; everyone gets BOTH. And man, it was yummy.

After the tasting (which also included going over, to the minute, the schedule for the reception&#8230;nutty stuff, but I&#8217;m glad the co-ordinator is on top of things), Carrie&#8217;s parents picked up Scout from day care and took him out to his &#8220;country house&#8221; (their house in Wheaton). Carrie and I packed up and headed out to Algonquin for Phase II &#8211; Adventures in Babysitting.

We had a good time, and introduced Kate to the wonder that is _The Princess Bride_. We also recorded a [pretty funny video][3], and took some good pictures.

On Sunday morning, after having breakfast with Ellie and Kevin, we headed off for Phase III &#8211; to Wisconsin and Beyond. Unfortunately, we got about 100 feet from the driveway and ran into a flat tire. After seeing the three hour wait at Costco, we went to Wal-Mart, who fixed our tire for only $9.50. We actually spent more money during the hour we were waiting and wandering the store than on the tire repair itself. So we headed onward for what was now Part Four of a Three-Part Weekend.

We arrived in Kohler, Wisconsin just as the Bears finished winning their game. We checked into our hotel at the American Club, which was FRIGGIN&#8217; NICE AS ALL HELL, and then had dinner at Chili&#8217;s. Seriously.

The evening was completed with a viewing of _The Holiday_ in Sheboygan, and then retiring to our lovely room with turn-down service. Can&#8217;t beat it.

We got up this morning, took some [neat pictures of the snow][5], had a fifty dollar breakfast, and then got [<img src="http://static.flickr.com/140/358824718_87c37175d5_m.jpg" title="Matt (by Matt Stratton)" alt="Matt (by Matt Stratton)" width="240" height="180" align="right" />][6]massages at the spa. After a Jewish Triathalon, we visited the Kohler showroom, and headed back towards civilization. After a quick stop at Culvers for some frozen custard, we were back in Chicago, and snug in our familiar apartment.

Oh, and we ended up having dinner from The Bagel tonight. Mmm. Soup.
