This was the latest rejection I got from the [IMDB][1]:

_Generally speaking, we&#8217;re looking for evidence someone is selling this film in a normal (i.e., not vanity press) distributor relation. CustomFlix does not count as independent for our purposes, though it is certainly a step up from making copies in your basement._

I&#8217;m glad I could spend years of my life and almost $10K on &#8220;vanity&#8221;. Maybe once I get the distribution deal with WB they&#8217;ll deign to list my shit.
