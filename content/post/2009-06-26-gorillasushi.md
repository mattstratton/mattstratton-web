_For those of you not familiar…Fussy Follow Friday is based upon the concept that instead of a glut of Twitter follow recommendations, I will make one, and ONLY ONE, follow recommendation per Friday. For more information, the Library of Congress recommends <a href="../2009/06/10/fussy-follow-friday/" target="_self">this blog post</a>._

<a href="https://twitter.com/gorillasushi" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-5403 alignright" style="margin: 3px 5px;" title="gorillasushi" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gorillasushi.jpg" alt="gorillasushi" width="85" height="85" /></a>This week, for Fussy Follow Friday, I recommend <a href="https://twitter.com/gorillasushi" target="_blank"><strong>@gorillasushi</strong></a> &#8211; not only is he a vague neighbor of mine (sort-of; we live about two suburbs away from each other), we actually went to school together. Not that you should follow someone just because they were a classmate of mine. If that was the case, everyone would follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ourmaninchicago" target="_blank">@ourmanichicago</a> (uh, crap, this is the second Fussy Follow Friday post where Scott got a shout-out without earning it. That can&#8217;t be good.)

Why should you follow <a href="https://twitter.com/gorillasushi" target="_blank">@gorillasushi</a>? It&#8217;s simple &#8211; quite frankly, he&#8217;s the funniest guy on Twitter. There is NO contest for this title. Jason is a &#8220;twitter sniper&#8221; &#8211; he only fires away when he knows he has a kill shot&#8230;humor-wise, that is. But don&#8217;t take MY word for it&#8230;let his tweets speak for themselves:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5399" title="gstweet1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gstweet1.jpg" alt="gstweet1" width="539" height="145" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gstweet1.jpg 539w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gstweet1-300x80.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" />][1][<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5400" title="gstweet2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gstweet2.jpg" alt="gstweet2" width="549" height="151" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gstweet2.jpg 549w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gstweet2-300x82.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" />][2][<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5401" title="gstweet3" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gstweet3.jpg" alt="gstweet3" width="538" height="186" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gstweet3.jpg 538w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gstweet3-300x103.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" />][3]See? Hilarious. Well worth your time. Why are you still debating? Add <a href="https://twitter.com/gorillasushi" target="_blank">@gorillasushi</a> to your follow list NOW. I promise he will be a lot funnier than any of the fake Britney Spears sex tape twitter accounts you&#8217;ve already added. Probably.
