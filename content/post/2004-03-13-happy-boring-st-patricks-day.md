I&#8217;m really sleepy. Was out too late last night and didn&#8217;t get much sleep. Supposed to go out with a bunch of friends tonight and I&#8217;ll probably go later, but for now I&#8217;m going to stay home and watch TV and surf the webbernet and relax on my new futon.

mugsymalone74 on AIM if you are likewise bored.
