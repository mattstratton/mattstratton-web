Apparently the [governor of our fair state doesn&#8217;t watch Comedy Central nearly enough][1].

> Gov. Rod Blagojevich wasn&#8217;t in on the joke.
> 
> Blagojevich says he didn&#8217;t realize &#8220;The Daily Show&#8221; was a comedy spoof of the news when he sat down for an interview that ended up poking fun at the sometimes-confused Democratic governor.
> 
> &#8220;It was going to be an interview on contraceptives &#8230; that&#8217;s all I knew about it,&#8221; Blagojevich laughingly told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in a story for Thursday&#8217;s editions. &#8220;I had no idea I was going to be asked if I was &#8216;the gay governor.&#8221;&#8217;
> 
> The interview focused on his executive order requiring pharmacies to fill prescriptions for emergency birth control. Interviewer Jason Jones pretended to stumble over Blagojevich&#8217;s name before calling him &#8220;Governor Smith.&#8221;
> 
> He urged Blagojevich to explain the contraception issue by playing the role of &#8220;a hot 17-year-old&#8221; and later asked if he was &#8220;the gay governor.&#8221;
> 
> At one point in the interview, a startled Blagojevich looked to someone off camera and said, &#8220;Is he teasing me, or is that legit?&#8221;
> 
> The segment, which aired two weeks ago, also featured state Rep. Ron Stephens, a Greenville Republican and pharmacist who opposes the governor&#8217;s rule. Stephens has said he knew the show was a comedy.
> 
> &#8220;I thought the governor was hip enough that he would have known that, too,&#8221; Stephens said.

Heh. I bet even Daley knows about the Daily Show. Of course, it&#8217;s probably just because he stays tuned for Crank Yankers.
