I&#8217;m a little behind in updating (this was SUCH a long and exhausting weekend), but I&#8217;m doing it now.

Day 3 &#8211; The Comedy Club

The day started out just fine &#8211; Dallas and I arrived at Beat Kitchen (the location) on time. Allen (the owner of Beat Kitchen) was very accomodating, and we got off to a good start.

The first scene we shot was with Emily and the bartender (played by Kristin Collins). Of course, as we set up for the shot, Ben noticed that we had no liquor bottles. Not wanting to impact Beat Kitchen&#8217;s business, we sent Andrew (our sound guy) out for booze (he needed to buy cigarettes anyway).

Today was also Tracy&#8217;s big screen debut (normally she&#8217;s the AD). She played the &#8220;hot girl&#8221; that Jason hits on at the bar. It really worked out well. When we were setting up the shot, Andy (who plays Jason) asked me &#8220;Should I smoke in this scene?&#8221;

&#8220;Sure,&#8221; I replied.

&#8220;Um&#8230;I don&#8217;t know how,&#8221; he confessed.

&#8220;Go ahead and use that,&#8221; was the brilliant direction I gave him. Hehe.

It worked really well, actually&#8230;in the first take, he somehow managed to burn his own ear with his cigarette. It was a pretty funny bit of business.

We also shot an interview scene with the bartender. Kristin was REALLY funny. I&#8217;m so glad we were able to use her; Dallas told me that we should make her promise to not get pregnant before we shoot our next picture.

Of course, only one of our extras even showed up today. This was a bit of a problem. Luckily, Tracy made a few phone calls, and Deidre, Trapper, and Mo came through in the pinch. This was a lifesaver.

Today was also the first day Dave (aka &#8220;Lippy&#8221;) was on set. He was pretty amazing with the lighting. It took an hour, but the way they lit the stage was amazing.

Got some great reaction shots today too. Kelly (&#8220;Samantha&#8221;) gave a great &#8220;daggers&#8221; look. Plus, as usual, Marla (&#8220;Mary&#8221;) was able to communicate Mormon uneasiness.

The &#8220;circle&#8221; scene took about six takes, but I got what I wanted. We finished up about 15-20 minutes ahead of schedule, and were ready to roll at 6. Allen had left for the day, and there was a bit of a misunderstanding with one of the bartenders (apparently she had been told we borrowed liquor from them, Which we didn&#8217;t. But everything was okay.

Went home afterwards and watched dailies with Dallas and Tracy.
