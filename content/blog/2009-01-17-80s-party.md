I&#8217;ve mentioned before that my wife is a big fan of Chicago author <a href="https://www.jennsylvania.com/" target="_blank">Jen Lancaster</a>. Through various machinations of the internets, somehow my wife&#8217;s book club became friendly with her and was even <a href="https://mattstratton.wordpress.com/2008/05/06/famous-by-proxy/" target="_blank">mentioned in her most recent book</a>.

This past Friday, my wife and I attended an 80&#8217;s Party at Jen&#8217;s house. Now, I feel that we&#8217;re getting to be quite good at the &#8220;dress up like the 80&#8217;s in an amusing way&#8221; thing &#8211; we had <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/92514650@N00/sets/72157594569124603/" target="_blank">Carrie&#8217;s birthday party at a roller rink</a>, plus we got all <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/mugsy/286326487/in/photostream/" target="_blank">80&#8217;s-a-fied</a> for Lippy&#8217;s birthday. But for this party, we felt like we had to take it up a notch.

(Interesting sidenote; if you do a Google image search for <a href="https://images.google.com/images?q=80s+look" target="_blank">&#8220;80s look&#8221;</a>, my picture comes up as the second picture in the result set. Heh.)

I decided to go for a &#8220;Don Johnson&#8221; type look; I found a light blue sort-of-pastel blazer at the Goodwill in Naperville, along with some loafers. I did not have pants that matched, nor could I find white pants that I was willing to purchase for single-use, so I elected to go with very light khakis. Not completely accurate, but good enough. I was all set to wear a white t-shirt under the blazer, but at the last minute on Friday afternoon Carrie found me a pink t-shirt to wear &#8211; along with a fake gold chain. Wal-Mart is awesome.

We got ready for the party at Jessica&#8217;s house on the north side. It didn&#8217;t take me nearly as long as the girls, so I amused myself by taking pictures of them getting ready, and of other random things in the house. Once preparations were complete, <a href="https://fullofsnark.com/" target="_blank">KJ</a> came and met us and the four of us heading out to Jen&#8217;s house.

Almost immediately after we walked in the door, another couple came in behind us. And lo and behold &#8211; the male half of the pair was completely color-matched with me. This caused a lot of mirth, despite the fact that none of us had anything to drink yet. And, of course, a photo op.

It turned out to be a pretty fun party, especially for one where I knew next to nobody. It was definitely female-heavy, which is to be expected, I suppose, if you are at a party hosted by a chick-lit bloggebrity. But everyone was super friendly and I enjoyed the never-ending stream of Miller High Life.

Because, as you know, it is the champagne of beers.

For your amusement, here are some more photos from the evening:
