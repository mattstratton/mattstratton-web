> I always entertain the notion that I&#8217;m wrong, or that I&#8217;ll have to revise my opinion. Most of the time that feels good; sometimes it really hurts and is embarrassing. But it&#8217;s not a problem for me to change positions. For instance, I think that beating up on Emeril was turning into shtick. He looks like [legendary chef Georges Auguste] Escoffier now compared to some of the bobble-heads who are on that network.

> Rachael Ray. She&#8217;s paid more and is more popular [than Emeril], and I see a day when the executives say, we don&#8217;t need Emeril anymore, even though he built their network. They&#8217;ll replace him with some industry-created freakozoid who&#8217;s been grown from a seedling into a recognized brand. When you look at Sandra Lee or Rachael Ray or some of the new shows like &#8220;Calorie Commando&#8221; that are just vomit-inducing &#8212; at least Emeril worked his way up and has a real restaurant empire.

> And he has been nice to me, shown incredible good humor about me calling him an Ewok. I went out drinking in New Orleans years ago with a lot of his cooks and employees, and they said he&#8217;s a good boss, a fair guy who looks after his people.
> 
> I still hate the show! But even the show, compared to Rocco DiSpirito, is Shakespeare. Rocco&#8217;s a really talented cook, way more talented than I ever was. But he wanted, with such an unholy fervor, to be on TV, to be loved by strangers.

> **Q: Will we see you in a year saying, &#8220;Oh, I had drinks with Rachael Ray, and actually, she&#8217;s all right&#8221;?**
> 
> Yeah, right. &#8220;After the hot-tub incident, I&#8217;ve changed my mind.&#8221; You know, listen, like I said, I could be wrong. Unlikely. But maybe she&#8217;s nice to puppies.
> 
> **Q: Sure, sure&#8211;you haven&#8217;t seen her kicking any old people lately.**
> 
> Actually, that would be cool. If I ever saw her getting trashed on Old Crow, pistol-whipping a vegan after a bar crawl, I would think, &#8220;That&#8217;s an interesting woman. I would like to know her.&#8221; 

Carrie doesn&#8217;t understand why I dislike Rachel Ray so much, but it&#8217;s good to see that someone besides and myself think she should be punched in the throat.
