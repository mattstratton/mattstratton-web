OK, so I&#8217;m not actively searching for a new job, but I was updating my resume yesterday with the training I just had, and did a couple searches. I found a job with a pretty big company locally here that looked like a good fit. I filled out their online app last night.

This morning I got an email from a recruiting manager with the email asking me to fill out a pre-interview questionaire. Which I did. About an hour later, the recruiting manager called me, and we chatted for a while about my current job, etc. He then told me that he was going to pass my resume along to his team tomorrow in their &#8220;resume review&#8221; meeting (after telling me that he didn&#8217;t include a lot of resumes in that meeting), to see where I might fit (since they had a few positions they were looking to fill). He said he would get back to me tomorrow or the day after with their feedback and any other questions.

Well, then about an hour after our call, I got this email:

> jobs@\***\***\***.com
  
> to me
> 
> 11:09 am (4 minutes ago)
> 
> Thank you for the interest you have shown seeking employment with \***\****.
> 
> Although we were impressed with your skills and background, at this time we have decided to pursue candidates whose qualifications more closely match our current needs. Your resume will be active in our database for consideration should other positions become available.
> 
> Thank you again for considering \***\*****, and we wish you much luck in the future.
> 
> **Please do not respond to directly to this email, this account is not maintained.

Crazy.

**Update:** &#8211; that email must have been a fluke in their system, as they just called me and scheduled a phone interview with the hiring manager for Thursday afternoon.
