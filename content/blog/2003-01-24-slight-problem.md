So things are going well with the search for the jobby job&#8230;

I have two interviews next week. The one on Monday seems really really promising&#8230;only problem is, it&#8217;s in the suburbs and I&#8217;d have to drive to it. And my car still needs the key replaced. And I won&#8217;t get the next Careerbuilder check in time to get it fixed before Monday morning. So right now I really have no idea how I&#8217;m going to get to that interview.

Which sucks, because they seem really excited about me.
