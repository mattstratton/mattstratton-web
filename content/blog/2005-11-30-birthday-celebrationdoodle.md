Hey NYC folks&#8230;I will be in town this weekend for a birthday party for me, Josh, Cindy, and supposedly Tomo, although she&#8217;s not sure she&#8217;s gonna show up for the party :)

**Date:** Saturday, Dec 3

**Time:** 9PM until Josh passes out and Cindy gets arrested for indecent exposure.

**Location:** Maker&#8217;s Bar
  
405 3rd Avenue
  
Between 28th and 29th

Hope to see you there!

Also, this is a test of my &#8220;NYC&#8221; filter. So, if you live in NYC, and can&#8217;t see this, let me know :)
