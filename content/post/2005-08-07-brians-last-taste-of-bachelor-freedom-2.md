I know it&#8217;s usually frowned upon to take pictures at bachelor parties, but this amount of sheer debauchery had to be captured for all to see. Brian can be seen here riding a video snowmobile with reckless abandon. In a few short weeks, his days of coasting through fake mountains while being portrayed as a giant Rastafarian man who throws atomic snowmobiles will be over.

Fare thee well, Independent Brian!
