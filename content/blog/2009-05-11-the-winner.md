On April 30, 2009, I <a href="/2009/04/30/feedback-prize/" target="_self">posted a contest</a> wherein by submitting feedback on Good Old Rock, you would be entered in a drawing for a $25 Amazon.com Gift Certificate. Here is the list of people for the drawing:

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5209" title="contest-names" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/contest-names-154x300.jpg" alt="contest-names" width="154" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/contest-names-154x300.jpg 154w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/05/contest-names.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 154px) 100vw, 154px" />

And then, using Random.org, a random number between 1 and 17 was selected:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5211" title="contest-result1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/contest-result1.jpg" alt="contest-result1" width="515" height="248" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/contest-result1.jpg 572w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/05/contest-result1-300x144.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" />
</p>

So congratulations to **Ari**, of <a href="https://curiousillusion.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Curious Illusion</a>, as the winner of the first-ever Good Old Rock contest! Your Amazon.com gift certificate will be emailed to you. Thanks to everyone who participated!
