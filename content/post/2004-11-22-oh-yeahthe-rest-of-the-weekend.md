Saturday was a pretty awesome day. Amanda slept in late, because she&#8217;s a wussbag. But once she finally got up, we decided to go visit the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens. Man, that was cool. But then again, I like those moving pictures.

Also, we found out that Amanda is the only person in the world that I can beat at DDR.

Afterwards, we had a dinner of ice cream at a diner, and then hoofed our way to Dana and Arfer&#8217;s place for his berfday dinner. We picked up a bottle of Nando-brand champagne, and I introduced everyone to the wonder that is Coppola Rosso (thanks to The Cook for introducing me to &#8220;the best $8 bottle of wine you&#8217;ll ever buy&#8221;). Watched crappy movies and ate pocky.

Yesterday went to brunch in DUMBO with Miss Behave, Sara Jane, Larry, Amanda, and Roberta. It was teh awesome &#8211; they had a bluegrass band playing. I think that the Hoyle Brothers should team up with a restaurant here and have a honky-tonk brunch. Afterwards we took Picola (is that how you spell it) to the park and threw rocks in the East River. Then Larry took me to the airport, because he is a Nice Guy and so pretty.

I flew home, finished reading my book, and decided to work from home today. The End.

So what did I learn?

I learned that hollandaise sauce in NYC tastes weird.

I learned that NY pizza is kind of lame.

I learned that pocky tastes good.

I learned that the subway is a lot more complicated than the CTA.

I learned that I really like Brooklyn.

I learned that Nando is more than just a language.
