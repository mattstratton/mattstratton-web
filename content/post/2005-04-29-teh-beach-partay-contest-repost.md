_Since Yehoodi is down until Monday or so, I searched my cache and found Marcelo&#8217;s post about the contest. I&#8217;m re-posting mostly for my own use, but in case any of you other jamoches need it._ 

We threw the coolest Partay of the year earlier this month. Now we need an excuse to drink the rest of the alcohol.

Since Audra has a beach house, and we&#8217;re sick of our apartment for the time being, we&#8217;re packing up the cat and shuttling down to sunny Newport Beach and throwing a Beach Blanket Bonanza, complete with swimsuit contest, Vodka watermelons, and Sno-Cones!!!! In addition to all this, we will also once again give out our Awesomely Bad DVD&#8217;s as door prizes!

Festivities are on Saturday May 21st, from 1pm til we drop!

And this time, you may not have to sit and watch on the webcam! ONE LUCKY WINNER is going to win a trip to beautiful BURBANK, CALIFORNIA to attend Teh Beach Partay! Your dream vacation includes shuttle service in a luxury entry-level Nissan Sentra to and from the party, including various points of interest, such as The Alhambra VFW (home of Sugarfoot Stop), California Pizza Kitchen at Glendale City Center, and Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City!

SO HOW DO I ENTER???

Airfare is expensive. So you need to work for your money. To win, you must write an essay addressing ONE (1) of the following prompts:

1. Write a review of Fernando R. Teson&#8217;s &#8220;The Liberal Case for Humanitarian Intervention,&#8221; available upon request. Feel free to cite other sources in the field of International Law to defend your argument.

2. Pick a favorite episode of &#8220;Seinfeld&#8221; or &#8220;Family Guy&#8221; and defend it as the best episode of the series. You are expected to compare and contrast your episode with other seminal episodes of the series in addition to extolling the virtues of your chosen episode.

3. Given that 14 years have elapsed since its initial release, do you feel it is still fair for Michael Stipe to refuse to perform the song &#8220;Shiny Happy People?&#8221; In a well-written essay, summarize the main issues involving bands and their one or two hit songs which fans constantly expect them to play, contrasted with the band&#8217;s need to break new musical ground. You may go outside R.E.M. for your essay, but please make sure to touch on the specific question as well.

4. Defend or condemn the practice of blues dancing, body shots and &#8220;pass the mint&#8221; at lindy exchanges. Are these shenanigans legitimate ways to have fun or childish substitutions for real physical intimacy?

5. Who is hotter, Drew or Marcelo?

All essays must follow the FIVE PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE and adhere to MLA standards. Essays will be graded on creativity, originality of argument, and depth of supporting material. Just saying &#8220;Marcelo is hotter&#8221; will not get you to Burbank. You must defend your thesis in a well-written five paragraph essay, Advanced-Placement-style. Bonus points for creative or provocative headshots, and for bringing Teh Funnay.

To enter, submit essay AND accompanying headshot to marcelo at paintedeyes dot org &#8211; Each essay will be read by one of our certified readers and then one lucky winner will receive up to a 200 dollar reimbursement towards their airfare.

Good luck to all contestants!
