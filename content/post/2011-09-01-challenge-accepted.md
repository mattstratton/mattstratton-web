So now that I&#8217;m coming off a (mostly) successful challenge with VEDA (Vlog Every Day in August) I am rolling right into another monthly challenge&#8230;

**BEDS &#8211; Blog Every Day in September**

I am definitely committing to posting SOME type of content every day this month. I will allow myself the excuse of missing a day when Baby Girl is born, but otherwise, I&#8217;m in.

I probably won&#8217;t follow all of the [prompts][1], but they&#8217;ll be a handy tool when I can&#8217;t think of a post idea.

Here we go!
