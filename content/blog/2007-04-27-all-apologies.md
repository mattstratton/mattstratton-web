Sorry for being lax at updating from the bachelor party weekend, etc, but I&#8217;ve been sick all week. It actually started on Monday when I was still in Vegas, and has gotten progressively worse throughout the week.

The good news is, it&#8217;s made it a lot easier to not smoke. I haven&#8217;t had a cigarette since Sunday night.
