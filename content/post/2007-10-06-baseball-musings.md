I&#8217;ll have more to say later. Right now, just some quickies:

1) I have turned off my phone, and will most likely not be taking calls at least until Monday. If you really have to reach me, call Carrie.

2) I honestly can&#8217;t say that I expected them to get to the NLCS, especially not after Thursday night. I did, however, expect them to pretend to fight.

3) It&#8217;s a shame the June Cubs showed up and not the September Cubs.

4) This is 99% the fault of the offense. Especially the &#8220;big guns&#8221;. I&#8217;d like to think they&#8217;re ashamed of themselves, but I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re being comforted tonight by sleeping on a big pile of money.
