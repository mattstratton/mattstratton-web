Carrie&#8217;s dad sent me this picture last week &#8211; it&#8217;s her late grandfather, Joe Staudacher, with the great Henry Aaron in the dugout at the old Milwaukee County Stadium.

What an amazing bit of baseball history. Well, not that it was historic for Hank Aaron to meet Carrie&#8217;s grandpa, but you know what I mean.

Makes you wonder if thirty years from now, some guy is going to look back at old pictures of his grandpa posing with Barry Bonds. I kind of doubt it.
