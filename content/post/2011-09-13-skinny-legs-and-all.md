Today, for <a href = "https://www.purekatherine.com/beds/">, the topic is &#8220;a fictional book.&#8221; One of my favorite books is _Skinny Legs And All_ by Tom Robbins.

I find myself re-reading this book at least once a year. Besides being absurd and witty, as most Robbins books are, the insights into the very nature of &#8220;art&#8221; have been incredibly influential to me in my writing and my filmmaking. It has colored my evaluations of the self-discovery process as well as made sure I never look at a can of beans the same way again. 

Sorry this is short &#8211; I&#8217;m writing this on my iPhone on the train, and, to be frank, keeping up with BEDS has been a challenge this month. There&#8217;s been a lot going on, and there&#8217;s more on the way. But I didn&#8217;t want to totally give up!
