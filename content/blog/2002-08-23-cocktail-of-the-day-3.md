Today&#8217;s drink is a pretty tasty &#8220;contemporary&#8221; martini. I like it because, unlike most of the other contemporaries, this one is a drink of subtlety, not complexity.

**Emerald Martini**

2 &#8211; 1/2 oz. Bacardi Limon
  
1/4 oz. Dry Vermouth
  
1/4 oz. Midori

Chill in mix cup with ice. Pour into chilled stemmed cocktail glass. Garnish with lemon twist.
