&nbsp;_Look at your LJ &#8220;interests&#8221; list. If you have fewer than 50 interests, pick every fifth one, and explain it. If you have between fifty and seventy-five interests, pick every seventh one. If you have over seventy-five interests, pick every tenth one. If you have fewer than ten, pick all of &#8217;em._

**abfab** &#8211; _Absolutely Fabulous_, a wonderful comedy show from the BBC, created by Jennifer Saunders. It&#8217;s all about decandance, excess, and lots and lots of vodka.
  
**bartending** &#8211; Actually, this isn&#8217;t accurate anymore, but there was a time when I was an aspiring bartender. Now I&#8217;m just an aspiring drunkard.
  
**caffeine** &#8211; The best legal drug on the market.
  
**cinematography** &#8211; Hey, I&#8217;m a filmmaker. Self-explanatory.
  
**coupling** &#8211; Brilliant Britcom. The NBC version sucked balls.
  
**david sedaris** &#8211; Wry humorist often featured on NPR.
  
**eddie izzard** &#8211; Hilarious British comedian favored by my friend Cherie.
  
**final cut pro** &#8211; The Mac-based NLE that I use to edit my movie masterpieces.
  
**golden apple** &#8211; The best diner in the world. Located just down the street from my house at the corner of Wellington/Southport/Lincoln. Featured on a &#8220;This American Life&#8221; episode.
  
**hedy burress** &#8211; actress who I went to college with. She&#8217;s been in a bunch of movies, and is really talented.
  
**humor** &#8211; Teh Funnay
  
**indie** &#8211; Teh Inday
  
**itunes** &#8211; This is what I use to play my musics. And to put them on my ipods.
  
**jocking the bitches** &#8211; There&#8217;s a story to this. For some reason a while ago, was having a hard time adding this to her &#8220;interests&#8221; list, so I tried to add it. It&#8217;s a reference from an Eazy-E song.
  
**kevin spacey** &#8211; He _is_ Kaiser Soze.
  
**liz phair** &#8211; I want a rock and roll girlfriend just like her.
  
**macintosh powerbooks** &#8211; I don&#8217;t have a Powerbook right now, but I loves them.
  
**mullets** &#8211; They scare me, but amuse me at the same time. Business up front, party in the back. Kentucky Waterfall in the house!
  
**os x** &#8211; The most magical operating system of all time. At least if you drink the same Kool-Aid that I do.
  
**pudding** &#8211; &#8220;If I know one thing, it&#8217;s that girls like to be called pudding&#8221; &#8211; Dallas Trinkle
  
**red wine** &#8211; the beverage, not the UB40 song. I hate that song.

**swing dancing** &#8211; It&#8217;s how I met most of you jackasses.
  
**the onion** &#8211; Journalism at its finest.
  
**theatre** &#8211; If it wasn&#8217;t for theatre, I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten into moviemaking.
  
**tom waits** &#8211; My stepfather introduced me to the music of Tom Waits. When I was growing up, I didn&#8217;t appreciate it. But now I see that the man is one of the most insightful and emotionally powerful songwriters today.
  
**waiting for guffman** &#8211; One of the best mock-docs ever made. &#8220;I hate you, and your ass face!&#8221;
  
**wrigley field** &#8211; this is my home away from home. It is my happy place. I&#8217;ve been a Cubs fan my whole life, and Wrigley fills me with such a feeling of nostalgia and history&#8230;love and disappointment&#8230;Old Style and Hebrew National.
