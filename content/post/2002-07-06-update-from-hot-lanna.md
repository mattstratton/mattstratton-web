Well, I&#8217;ve been here in Atlanta for a few days now&#8230;I suppose I should update&#8230;

Monday I arrived with no great shakes. Pretty straightforward flight (quick connection in Charlotte, and then a hop to Atlanta). Julie picked me up, we headed back to her place by way of the Kroger (we were both amused&#8230;and frightened&#8230;by the fact that the dairy case &#8220;moos&#8221; at you. And the egg shelves cluck like chickens. What&#8217;s THAT all about?)

Tuesday I spent the morning doing some writing (mostly idea fishing) and then Stephanie picked me up and we went to Q-Time for soul food. We got it takeaway, and ate it on her front porch. I had fried chicken, candied yams, and collard greens. And sweet tea. Which is my new favorite thing EVER.

Tuesday night was \*supposed\* to be spent at &#8220;Screen on the Green&#8221; watching _Viva Las Vegas_ projected outside. But a pretty intense thunderstorm put the kibosh on that, so Amy and I went over to Gayle&#8217;s house to watch movies. We watched _A Streetcar Named Desire_ along with Gayle&#8217;s roommates and their less-than-cultured friends. Amusement was had by all.

Wednesday I spent the morning re-reading _On The Road_ and then went with Joanne and Stephanie (and Joanne&#8217;s daughter) to tour some famous cemetary in Atlanta. Joanne dropped me off at the High (the Atlanta art museuem) where I was to meet up with Christina (one of Julie&#8217;s friends in town to run the Peachtree). Well, due to a communication mixup between Christina and I, we missed out on the High, but instead had a FINE snack at Houlihan&#8217;s (that was sarcasm) and wandered the streets of downtown Atlanta for a couple hours. Had a pretty good time with Christina; we talked movies (surprise, surprise).

Wednesday night had dinner with Gayle, Amy, Christina, and Julie at an Asian joint; then Amy and I went to the Marriot for the Wednesday night swing night. Apparently here in Atlanta, Wednesday night is the &#8220;ECS/lounger&#8221; night and Thursday is the &#8220;Lindy hopper&#8221; night. Either way, I sat at the bar, drank, and chatted with some of the local lounger types.

Thursday was spent at Gayle&#8217;s, with her boyfriend (I think) Adam, as well as Amy and her friend Jason. Jason spent about two hours trying to jury-rig a VGA gender changer to hook up his laptop to the TV so we could play DDR, and it never did quite work, so we put together a system using my video camera, so we were able to play after all. I&#8217;m getting better at DDR, but I still suck ass.

Today I helped Julie stain her new deck, and then we had a &#8220;vintage/cheesecake&#8221; photo shoot with Julie and Steph. It was really fun, although I wish I had been able to bring my lights and gels. But we made do. Took some fun pictures (actually, we took about 200), which I&#8217;ll bring home, play with in Photoshop, and the girls will have some fun prints. Maybe if Julie lets me, I&#8217;ll post up one or two of the &#8220;safer&#8221; ones here.
