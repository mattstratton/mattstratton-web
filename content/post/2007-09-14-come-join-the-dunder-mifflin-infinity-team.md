So there&#8217;s this new goofy online game thing for The Office, called [Dunder Mifflin Infinity][1].

I have applied to be the Regional Manager of the Gary, IN branch.

The more people I get to register as &#8220;employees&#8221; of me, the greater my chance of being &#8220;hired&#8221;. Once &#8220;hired&#8221;, the team works on games to earn SchruteBucks, which can be redeemed for prizes, apparently.

So if you want to play, go to [www.dundermifflininfinity.com][1], and sign up an an &#8220;employee&#8221; of the Gary, IN branch &#8211; with hiring code y0k0yjw5hz. The first person to sign up under me will earn the coveted title of Assistant to the Regional Manager.
