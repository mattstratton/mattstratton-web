OK, why the fuck does everyone think that last night&#8217;s episode of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ (&#8220;Beneath You&#8221;), featured GOOD acting by James Marsters (&#8220;Spike&#8221;)?

I&#8217;m lifting a lot of this from my post on [Yehoodi][1].

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, kids.

I think there is some fine acting on _Buffy_. I enjoy _Buffy_. It&#8217;s a lot of fun.

And I think that James Marsters is a good actor. But let&#8217;s get serious. Tonight the boy was chewing scenery like Homer Simpson in the sequel to Rent.

I thought his performance in the &#8220;Spike origin&#8221; episode (I don&#8217;t recall the name &#8211; the one where we see how he became a vamp, etc) was a much stronger performance on Marster&#8217;s part.

Because a character is written with internal struggle does not automatically make the actor multi-layered. Let&#8217;s separate the two, please.

The funny thing is I&#8217;d watched a Mr. Show With Bob And David episode earlier in the day &#8211; in one of the sketches, a guidance counselor was telling Bob and David that acting was just &#8220;jumping around and yelling.&#8221;

I think that&#8217;s the same direction Marsters got in the scene in the alley.

Just because the boy is hot and y&#8217;all wanna bone him doesn&#8217;t make over-the-top performances of internal struggle GOOD.

Personally, I think Emma Caulfield is the best actor on that show. Because, at it&#8217;s roots (in my opinion), Buffy is a dark comedy. And Caulfield (along with Nicholas Brendon) are two of the best comedic actors on that show.

Please. Let&#8217;s not fall into the &#8220;dramatic scene means great acting&#8221; trap.
