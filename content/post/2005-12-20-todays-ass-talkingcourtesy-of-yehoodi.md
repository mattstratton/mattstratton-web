We all know that I get cranky online when I&#8217;m sick, but I think this guy is just being a doofus.

> I maintain a web page for my dad, which is not a big deal, but I want to break things when he asks why his &#8220;ad&#8221; no longer appears at the top of a google search. (When I first launched the site, he was one of the few selling the product online. Now the big boys with slick websites have moved in, and consumers seem happy to pay 40% more to subsidize them.) I keep telling him that I don&#8217;t work for Google, and have no control over their search engine, but he doesn&#8217;t get it.

The way I see it, that&#8217;s not for Google to answer either. It&#8217;s more of a marketing question. That&#8217;s like running an ad in the newspaper and then expecting the NY Times to explain how 10 people came in your store, but only 3 of them bought something.
