This was the conversation today at lunch. Jeff and I were talking about using [Google Calendar][1], and synchronizing it with our phones, etc. John was laughing at us for making our scheduling lives more complicated.

**Fat Johnny:** I have Lotus Notes at work. And at home, I have my wife.
  
**Jeff:** Do you have some kind of [HA][2] solution for your wife?
  
**Matt:** Yeah, what happens if your wife goes down?
  
**Fat Johnny:** I write it on the calendar.
