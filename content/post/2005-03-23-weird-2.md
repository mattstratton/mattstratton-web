So I had a really bizarre dream last night.

Most likely inspired by the fact that I fell asleep watching Scrubs, I dreamt that I was hanging out with Zach Braff and Sarah Chalke at Lou and Julee&#8217;s house. Except that their house was huge. There was a whole room dedicated to a fireplace, and one whole wall was a plasma TV.

Anyway, at one point, something came up about some girl there flirting with me (I don&#8217;t remember anything about her, except that I think that she kind of looked like Rosario Dawson). So the next thing I know, Sarah Chalke says something about how she knows that this other girl isn&#8217;t as much into sex as she is, so she volunteers to have sex with me to &#8220;take the pressure off&#8221;.

But then, for some reason, it turns into me making out with Zach Braff while naked.

I have no idea what this dream means.
