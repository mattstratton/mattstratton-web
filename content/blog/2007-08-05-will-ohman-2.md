Will Ohman is the new LaTroy Hawkins.

ETA &#8211; I&#8217;m happy for Tom Glavine. 300 wins is quite an accomplishment.

But I really wanted to see the Cubs shut him down tonight because of ESPN&#8217;s assumption that it was a given that tonight would be his 300th win.

ESPN.com had it posted already as of the fifth inning. And I hate Joe Morgan with the passion of a 1,000 suns.

That being said, I kind of wish this game (for the Mets) had been against the Giants. I think Joe Morgan&#8217;s head would have exploded having to switch between verbally fellating Bonds and Glavine. Which is unfair, because Glavine actually \*deserves\* it.
