I clearly haven&#8217;t gotten my Project 365 photoblog set up yet, so I&#8217;m going to keep posting them here&#8230;for the time being. Here&#8217;s today&#8217;s feature:

<h2 style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Change We Can Believe In</strong>
</h2>

[<img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3658/3568909900_8a005b6a85.jpg" alt="6/365 - Change We Can Believe In" width="500" height="333" />][1]{.tt-flickr.tt-flickr-Medium}

There&#8217;s really no political significance to this shot. I really like the textures of the coins, and I think the background turned out well (no, I don&#8217;t have a photobox; that&#8217;s actually the black pad on the top of my desk&#8230;yay IKEA). I was inspired by Joe McNally&#8217;s picture/comment in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321544080?ie=UTF8&tag=straigeyefort-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0321544080" target="_blank"><em>The Moment It Clicks</em></a> (or maybe it was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321580141?ie=UTF8&tag=straigeyefort-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0321580141" target="_blank"><em>The Hot Shoe Diaries</em></a>) where he shows a picture he took of some gold coins, totally randomly, and it turned out to be one of his most lucrative stock shots ever.

Not that I&#8217;m expecting that from this, but it was my inspiration.
