Due to some technical difficulties (ahem, laziness!), I got a little behind on my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mugsy/sets/72157612213865503/" target="_blank">52 Weeks Project</a>. However, I did bang out weeks 9 and 10 (I am posting this during Week 11, but I still have several days to take that photo). Here they are, for your viewing pleasure:

</p>

This was taken with my new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50D-15-1MP-Digital-Body/dp/B001EQ4BVI%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001EQ4BVI" target="_blank">Canon 40D</a>, and my beautiful, gorgeous new lens, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009R6WT?ie=UTF8&tag=straigeyefort-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00009R6WT" target="_blank">EF24-70mm f/2.8L USM</a>. I just shot this in my office on my Gorillapod (which is just barely able to hold up that body and lens) and bounced the flash off the ceiling. Used my favorite Photoshop trick on this one (middle layer desaturated, top layer is set to Soft Light). This portrait doesn&#8217;t really say much, but I like how it turned out &#8211; although it is a little dark.

Something a little different with this one. Same gear as the above portrait, but for this I decided to depart from the &#8220;face&#8221; and investigate shadows in a t-shirt. Jacked up the contrast using Curves in Photoshop, but that&#8217;s about it.
