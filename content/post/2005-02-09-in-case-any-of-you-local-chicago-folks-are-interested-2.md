Beautifully sharp large screen. Visible from almost any angle in the room. Includes 3 S-Video/Composite inputs, one Component input, and one coaxial/antenna input. Small cosmetic damage to the top of console. Minor burn-in on screen (barely visible and only on large flat colors). Includes stand.

Make me an offer.
