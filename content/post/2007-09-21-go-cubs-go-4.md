My boss stopped by my desk yesterday and told me that since his wife was sick, he had an extra ticket to today&#8217;s game. As he put it, since he&#8217;s the one who approves my time-off requests, there was no reason for me not to go.

I went on Monday and Tuesday nights, and have tickets for Sunday as well. That&#8217;s four games in seven days. I wonder if my wife will remember what I look like.
