I will now attempt to recap my weekend, which was mostly pretty boring.

It all started on Saturday morning. Saturday, March 4th, was Carrie&#8217;s birthday. I&#8217;d planned a weekend away for the two of us. Our destination was as surprise for her. I didn&#8217;t feel like driving, though, so I arranged for alternate transportation.

After we arrived in New York City (Carrie&#8217;s never been there before), we dropped our bags at the hotel and took a walk. I took Carrie to a very famous NYC deli for lunch.

After lunch, it was tourist time. We headed over to Rockefeller Center to earn our tourist stripes. After taking a billion pictures of people ice skating, the two of use took the elevator all the way to the Top of the Rock. It was very pretty up there. A nice tourist took our picture as well.

Of course, there&#8217;s nothing more romantic than being 70 floors up with the wind whipping in your hair. Well, in your girlfriend&#8217;s hair &#8211; mine is kind of short. So I said &#8220;I have one more surprise for you&#8221;. I dropped to one knee, pulled a diamond ring from my pocket, and said &#8220;Carrie F\___\___, will you marry me?&#8221;

She burst into tears, and said &#8220;You are NOT doing this!&#8221; and turned away from me.

I kneeled there in shock. I had prepared for every contingency, except for a &#8220;no&#8221;.

After what seemed like fifteen minutes, I finally said &#8220;Well?&#8221; She said &#8220;Of COURSE I am saying yes!&#8221; She gave me her hand, and I put the ring on. We kneeled together for a few minutes, and hugged while she kept crying.

After a few minutes, she was composed enough for me to take a picture.

As we walked around the Top of the Rock, Carrie told me she had noticed that the tourist who took our picture earlier had been snapping shots of us while I proposed. So we spent about ten minutes exploring all three levels of the observation deck looking for this guy, but with no luck.

After the proposal brouhaha, it was dinner time. First, we checked into our hotel. After explaining to the reception guy that I was not going to be renting any movies, since I&#8217;d just proposed, he upgraded us (for free) to a suite. Which was sweet. Seriously. Let the pun go.

Part 2 will be along shortly! In the meantime, take a look at [the pictures on Flickr][9]:
