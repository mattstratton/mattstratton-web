First of all, Cubs tickets go on sale in a little less than two hours. I&#8217;m trying to get some tickets for the Friday of the bachelor party, and for opening day. Here&#8217;s hoping that I don&#8217;t get jacked by the &#8220;virtual waiting room&#8221;!

Also, on the train this morning I started reading [_Innocent When You Dream &#8211; The Tom Waits Reader_][1]. So far I am LOVING it. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Waits, especially

**Update** &#8211; I was able to get four tickets for the April 20 game against St. Louis, which is for the bachelor party. Awesome. Here&#8217;s where our seats are:

**Update #2** &#8211; I was able to get in again and bought four seats for Memorial Day for Carrie&#8217;s dad and his friends from out of town. I tried for the home opener, but they didn&#8217;t have two tickets together available. Sad.

**Update #3** &#8211; I got one more pair of tickets for a night game in June vs. the Rockies (for Carrie and myself). Here&#8217;s where the seats are (row 11):

Update the Final** &#8211; My boss was never able to get into the system, but I was able to get in and bought some tickets for him. I also got in again and got four bleacher tickets to a Thursday afternoon game in July vs. the Giants.
