OK, I know everyone for some reason today seems to be thinking &#8220;Oh wow&#8230;_Back to the Future 2_ predicted the Cubs would win the World Series in 2003!&#8221;

Not quite.

In the film, Marty sees a news broadcast in 2015 that announces the Cubs winning the World Series over Miami.

Still funny as shit though.
