I went to the game last night with my sister Debbie. We had a pretty good time. Well, four beers&#8217; worth of a good time at least. The game wasn&#8217;t exactly a pitchers&#8217; duel (is it possible to have a pitchers&#8217; duel when Marquis is on the mound?) but it was exciting all the same. 

After the 7th inning, I was getting up to go to the bathroom (along with 75% of the crowd) and I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around, and it was Alexis. Turns out that she and Ray were sitting just on the other side of the aisle from us. Pretty funny.

Sunday I am going to the game with my father-in-law. Here&#8217;s hoping the Rockies continue to be as terrible as they were last night.
