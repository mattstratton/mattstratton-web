I am not sure that I&#8217;m going to be posting these every day here (I&#8217;ll set up a separate photoblog for this), but I have kicked off my Project 365 attempt. Basically, inspired by <a href="http://www.jasondanielphotography.com/blog/" target="_blank">Jason</a> and <a href="http://curiousillusion.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Ari</a>, I&#8217;m forcing myself to take a picture every day for a year. Yes, I know my <a href="/tags/52-weeks/" target="_self">52 Weeks project</a> fizzled out. But I think that&#8217;s mostly because I get bored of seeing myself.

So here is today&#8217;s picture. It&#8217;s very basic, but I thought it was actually a pretty good &#8220;introduction&#8221; picture.
