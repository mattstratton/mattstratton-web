It&#8217;s not as bad as , but still making me a little shaken up.

I collected my first door prize this morning. I was riding down Wells, under the L tracks, which gets kind of weird. If you look at this picture, it will help the story:

See how there&#8217;s the area on the &#8220;outside&#8221; of the L tracks, where the cars are parked? I was riding in that area, on the west side of the street (Wells runs south). Some guy opens his car door suddenly, and whammo! I&#8217;m knocked over.

Luckily, there were no cars coming (I was knocked into the lane of traffic). The guy held his hand out to me and said &#8220;Oh my God, are you okay?&#8221;

I shrugged and said &#8220;You gotta watch where you&#8217;re going, dude.&#8221; He apologized. I looked down at my bike, and saw a crack in the plastic guard on the sprocket. The chain was mis-aligned as well.

A little upset, I told the guy I needed his info, since he hit me, and my bike was new, and I needed him to pay for any damage he did, since he was liable (I just read about that the other day). He started getting indignant &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, is this the street? No, I think the street is OVER THERE&#8221; (pointing to the area under the tracks).

I told him that I was just a little freaked out, since it was a new bike, I had to make sure I could ride it the rest of the way to work, and back home again. I told him I wasn&#8217;t trying to be an asshole, but I just wanted his information. So he gave me his card, apologized again, and said he was glad I wasn&#8217;t hurt.

I agreed.

So once I got to the office, I pulled the guy&#8217;s card out.

He&#8217;s a lawyer.

Leave it to me, to get doored by a freakin&#8217; lawyer.

I have to bring my bike into the shop after work anyway (since they still didn&#8217;t fix my shifter), so I&#8217;m going to have them check it out.

**Update** &#8211; I called the police to see if I should file a police report, and was told that I defintely should. From curb to curb, it&#8217;s all street. However, to file a report, I at least need the make/model of his car, preferably the license plate number. The woman on the phone said that his card would not be good enough, since he could have given me anyone&#8217;s card. Although I did go to the website on the card, and looked up his profile with the firm. It&#8217;s him, and he&#8217;s a partner there. I think the guy could totally afford to pay for a new chain guard for me. I&#8217;m going to walk down that way after my 10 am meeting to see if I can find his car and write down the info.

**Update to the update** &#8211; I walked over there during lunch, and I&#8217;m 99% sure I found his car. I got the license plate number (which as a &#8220;Fraternal Order of Police&#8221; plate, fantastic), and will be filing a report this afternoon when I figure out which police department to go to.
