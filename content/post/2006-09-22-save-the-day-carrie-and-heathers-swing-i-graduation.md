Carrie and Heather (pictured here) have been taking Swing I with [Big City Swing][1] on Monday nights.

For those of you local, on Monday, Oct 2, at 9:30 PM at [Fizz Bar and Grill][2] will be their &#8220;graduation dance&#8221;. So you should totally come out and dance with them. Or at least have a drink and watch them dance.
