For those of you in the Chicago area who are looking for places for brunch, do NOT go to Square Kitchen.

We first tried Square Kitchen for dinner when we moved into the neighborhood &#8211; we found the food overpriced and unremarkable.

Thinking perhaps it was better for brunch, we gave it a try this morning. I can&#8217;t tell you how the food was, since we left before ordering due to the terrible service we received.

When we entered the restaurant, the gentleman working at the host stand rudely told us &#8220;on minute&#8221; without even making eye contact, while he proceeded to instruct a co-worker on the intricacies of their computer system. We were finally seated, and then waited almost ten minutes before our server came to take our order.

After ordering our food, we were told that the kitchen was &#8220;really backed up&#8221;, and it might take longer than usual to get our food. At this point, we&#8217;d had enough, and we decided to leave.

As we were leaving, the host asked me why &#8211; I told him that he was very rude to us by the way he greeted us. He told me that he was not. I told him that in my opinion, the customer was more important than teaching someone how to use the computer system. He then said &#8220;You know what? Buh-bye.&#8221; When I told him we waited almost ten minutes until we were served, he then told me that I was wrong.

I will never go back to this restaurant &#8211; the service was rude and accused me of lying. I will also be sending a letter to the owner of the restaurant, although since they manage to pack the place every Sunday, apparently nobody cares. In fact, as I was leaving, I told someone entering the restaurant that the service was terrible. His reply? &#8220;Yes, I know. We were here last week.&#8221;

Disgusting.
