I&#8217;m really tired, so I&#8217;m not going to post much about this &#8211; full recap and thoughts later. But for now, some quick notes (mostly for myself for later) on the Cubs game/Ryne Sandberg jersey retirement ceremony.

  * Fans chanting &#8220;Santo! Santo!&#8217; when the President of the Hall of Fame was speaking about Cubs in the Hall
  * Amazing 8-run bottom of the 7th, which led off with a triple from Zambrano
  * Alfonseca being tossed for arguing with the umpire and literally taking his ball and going home
  * D-Lee breaking his two game 0-4 slump with not one, but TWO dingers &#8211; the first one on the first pitch, and narrowly missing the &#8220;Ryne Sandberg &#8211; 2nd to None&#8221; banner in the bleachers
  * D-Lee breaking Ernie Banks&#8217;s record for the most single season home runs for a Cubs first baseman.
  * Some jackass throwing a beer from the upper deck
