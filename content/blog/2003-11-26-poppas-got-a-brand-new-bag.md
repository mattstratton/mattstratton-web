So I just got a new bag for my Powerbook.

It&#8217;s from Booq. It&#8217;s totally cool. It came with a sleeve to protect the PB, plus it&#8217;s got a bajillion pockets. I will be testing it out tonight when I go to my mom&#8217;s house&#8230;we&#8217;ll see if it works to carry overnight stuff plus my computer.
