First of all, to get it out of the way, remember last week when I told you guys about our [infertility situation][1]? Yeah, that procedure didn&#8217;t work. So we&#8217;re **moving on to IVF**. Carrie just called in the prescription for her medications for this process, and they were $400! Which sounds like a lot of money until we found out that our insurance was coughing up $4,000 towards them. I&#8217;m so glad we have good insurance.

This will be a short week for me &#8211; on Thursday I&#8217;m going to Microsoft for a session about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank">cloud computing</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/azure/default.mspx" target="_blank">Azure</a>. Then, Thursday evening, Carrie and I are heading out to Ft. Lauderdale for a long weekend. No major plans for the weekend, except for **hanging out where it&#8217;s warm** (although it&#8217;s only supposed to be in the high 60s while we&#8217;re there). We are going to South Beach for a day, and hopefully meeting up with Kevin and <a href="http://scrapplequeen.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">Nora</a> at the same time. Which reminds me&#8230;I need to email them about that. Unless I get lucky and they read this blog post first.

Valentines Day was fun. For breakfast, Carrie made fresh-squeezed orange juice, &#8220;real&#8221; bacon (we only eat real bacon on special occasions, or when we go out for breakfast, which we do about once a week, so it&#8217;s not that big of a sacrifice), and pancakes shaped like hearts. It was delicious. **Even Scout got a pancake**. He enjoyed it. For dinner, I made filet mignon in red wine sauce, along with asparagus risotto. We had shrimp cocktail for an appetizer. We made dessert together, which was white chocolate mousse with strawberries, and capped the night off by watching _Nick and Norah&#8217;s Infinite Playlist_. Overall, a nice, chill, V-Day.

Things are going well at work. I completed the performance reviews for my team yesterday, and will hopefully get my review either today or tomorrow. I registered for a dinner-and-discussion (that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m calling it, since it&#8217;s not a &#8220;lunch-and-learn&#8221;) with <a href="http://www.sharepointjoel.com/" target="_blank">Joel Oleson</a> in March. Next week is the Azure Cloud Computing User&#8217;s Group meeting in Downers Grove, and I&#8217;m also going to the Bulls game on Tuesday with a vendor, which should be fun. Still not sure if I&#8217;ll be going to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/TechEd2009/" target="_blank">TechEd</a> this year; I gave up my pass to the DBA manager here (he&#8217;s never been) and I **have to decide between that or the** <a href="http://www.mssharepointconference.com" target="_blank"><strong>SharePoint Conference</strong></a> **in October**. I&#8217;m thinking that I am going to try to get to the SharePoint one for two reasons:

  1. I went to TechEd last year
  2. The SharePoint conference is in Vegas

I&#8217;m kidding, of course. I really want to go to it because there&#8217;ll be a lot of information about Sharepoint &#8220;14&#8221;, and I just have a feeling that TechEd (for me) would be Azure overload. 

I&#8217;m trying to write this week&#8217;s blog content in advance, since I&#8217;ll functionally be offline after Thursday morning. I should, at least, have tomorrow&#8217;s Web Wanderings, Thursday&#8217;s Tech Tips, and the Friday Fun. Probably won&#8217;t have any posts over the weekend though. 

Speaking of <a href="/topics/tech-tips/" target="_self">Tech Tips</a>, my friend Ed had requested that this week I focus on anti-malware software for the Mac, but since I haven&#8217;t had the chance to do any research on that front, my plan is to post a **shoot-out of BlackBerry Twitter clients**. Hopefully that will be of interest to some readers &#8211; it better be, since I&#8217;ve been suffering through testing multiple ones all week and my BlackBerry&#8217;s battery is getting worn out.
