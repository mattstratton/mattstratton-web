I know that for some people, making bitchy posts is still the thing to do. It sounds like a good idea at the time, so they go for it. Fine. Groovy. Best of luck to them. But how does one pull one&#8217;s friend aside and say, &#8220;Dude, you&#8217;re just jealous?&#8221; The answer is, one doesn&#8217;t. One just hangs one&#8217;s head and makes that &#8220;tsk, tsk&#8221; noise with one&#8217;s tongue and hopes that five days from now, the catfight isn&#8217;t too terrible.
