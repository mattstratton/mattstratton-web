OK, I&#8217;m bored with Vista.

It&#8217;s not very useful to me to even play with inside of a VM &#8211; mostly because I can&#8217;t get to Windows Update and stuff as long as I have it installed without a product key (30 day demo). And I&#8217;m not about to burn the license key for this installation in the VM.

I guess I&#8217;ll just have to wait until I feel comfortable enough to upgrade the laptop. Although I&#8217;m tempted to create a second partition and install Vista on that &#8211; in theory, that won&#8217;t prevent me from re-installing the same copy of Vista over the XP on this same laptop, right?

Now i just gotta go burn a copy of the [GParted LiveCD][1]!
