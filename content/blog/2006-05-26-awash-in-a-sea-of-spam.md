For some reason, within the last 24 hours, I&#8217;ve gotten NAILED hard with spam.

From what I can see, it&#8217;s mostly going to my matt at gravytrainfilms.com email address, not my gmail.

I want to figure out a new plan for harnassing spam.

Here&#8217;s how my email works &#8211; the only inbox I use is my Gmail inbox. All of my other email (mattstratton.com, gravytrainfilms.com, windyhop.org) is hosted on the Windyhop server, which runs MailEnable as the mail server. We have a few antispam filters in place on the server &#8211; actually, it&#8217;s just dns blacklisting. It&#8217;s doing a lot, but not nearly enough.

What I would like to do is move my email domains off of the Windyhop server and put some kind of challenge/response system in place, hosted somewhere else. Have any of you had any luck with any of those kind of systems, and what would you recommend? Pretty much all of my day-to-day email is done via the gmail address &#8211; most people who email me know that email address, so slowing people down with a challenge system for the other addresses wouldn&#8217;t be the end of the world
