Just a note.

A lot of you out there know that I love Tivo. Even though I actually did give up my Tivo yesterday, in favor of my Comcast HD DVR box.

Anyway. My request to you all is&#8230;if you purchase/activate Tivo service, and I was the one who inspired you to go with Tivo, please put my email address (matt dot stratton at gmail dot com) as your referral.

Sadly, you can&#8217;t do this retroactively. I know of at least two people who realized, too late, that they should have referred to me. if those people had done so, I&#8217;d have a free iPod now :)

Thanks!

Edit: put me as a referral when she got her Tivo. This is reason #213 that I am her number one fan.
