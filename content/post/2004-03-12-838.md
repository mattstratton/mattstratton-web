Last night I attended <a href="http://www.chicagofilmfestival.org/cgi-bin/WebObjects/CIFFSite.woa/wa/Products/40CHITV" target="_blank">the Hugo awards</a> with my friend Brian. It was actually pretty cool. As a Tivo user, I don&#8217;t watch many commercials. And it was pretty eye-opening to realize how much good stuff can be done in that short span of time.

_**THE HUGOS &#8211; Honoring the Best in Television**
  
The Chicago International Television Competition will be honoring its 2004 winners on March 11, 2004 at Park West.&#160; The evening will feature Career Achievement Awards&#160;to master TV commercial director Joe Pytka and celebrated journalist Carol Marin.&#160;General admission and reserved seating tickets are still available.&#160; Cocktails and hors d&#8217;oeuvres start at 5:30PM, with ceremonies beginning at 7:00PM.&#160;&#160;Some will go home with a Hugo.&#160; For everyone else, well, there&#8217;s an open bar . . ._

Met some cool folks, and the editor-in-chief of <a href="http://www.screenmag.com/" target="_blank"><em>Screen</em> magazine</a> now has my card and knows who I am. Made some other connections with a video production company that is up and coming in Chicago as well &#8211; they want me to come in and do a voice-over thing for a jingle. Well, it could be a foot in the door with them, if not on the wrong side of things :)

Seriously though. A fun night.
