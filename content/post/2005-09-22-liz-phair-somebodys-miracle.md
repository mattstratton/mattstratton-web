So I got my hands on an advance copy of Liz Phair&#8217;s new album, _Somebody&#8217;s Miracle_.

It&#8217;s absolute trash. I am so disappointed. I actually LIKED the last album. But seriously, Kelly Clarkson rocks harder than Liz does on this album.

I&#8217;m going to give it a few more listens to see what happens, but my initial feedback is that it&#8217;s predictable, too smooth around the edges, and very far removed from any semblance of rock and roll. It&#8217;s like listening to Celine Dion sing about blowjobs.
