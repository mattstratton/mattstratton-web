OK, so based upon feedback from my last &#8220;regrets&#8221; survey&#8230;I&#8217;ve decided to do it again, but this time with anonymous commenting.

So anyone can see the results (I think), but you can reply anonymously. Plus, I turned off IP logging.

So the question is&#8230;who do you regret? Reply anonymously if you want.

**Note: In order to allow anonymous replies, I had to make it a public entry. FYI.**

On the flipside&#8230;who are you most proud of? Or barring that, which was the best?

Throw me a bone here&#8230;I home sick all week and I need a distraction
