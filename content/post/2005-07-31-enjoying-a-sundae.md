Here&#8217;s a picture of me enjoying a sundae at the Durham Bulls&#8217; game a few weekends ago. I just kept thinking of &#8220;The Lip Reader&#8221;:

**Elaine:** Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.

**Kramer:** Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight.
