  title: "Who am I?"
  content: >
    <p class="lead">
      I am an experienced DevRel leader, a well-known member of the DevOps community, founder and co-host of the popular <a href = "https://www.arresteddevops.com/" target = "_blank">Arrested DevOps podcast</a>, and a global organizer of the <a href = "https://www.devopsdays.org/" target = "_blank">DevOpsDays</a> set of conferences..   
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
      I have over 20 years of experience in IT operations and am a sought-after speaker internationally, presenting at Agile, DevOps, and cloud engineering focused events worldwide. Demonstrating my keen insight into the changing landscape of technology, I recently changed my license plate from <code>DEVOPS</code> to <code>KUBECTL</code>.

    I live in Chicago and have three awesome kids and two Australian Shepherds, whom I loves just a little bit more than I loves Diet Coke.

    - name: "Jeff Meisel"
      position: "Aiven, Senior Director of Revenue Marketing"
      content: "As a DevOps industry veteran (with leadership roles at RedHat, PagerDuty, and Chef to name a few), Matty is skilled in a number of domains including solution architecture, community development, and business transformation. I saw first-hand at Aiven how he applied those skills to scale our organization as we built a dual-funnel across PLG and the Enterprise (SLG) sales motions. In the past 12 months specifically, Matty took on the Growth Marketing function in addition to DevRel, and was the principal leader at the company responsible for driving >100% goal attainment in active users (a KPI that was accountable to the Board of Directors). If you are looking for a team-first DevRel leader, with the technical and business chops to drive user adoption within both a PLG and SLG organization, and who happens to be incredibly fun to work with — Matty is your guy!"
