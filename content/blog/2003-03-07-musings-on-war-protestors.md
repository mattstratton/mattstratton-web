**What to do if you happen upon a peace rally run by naive hemp-shirt-wearing college idiots to teach them why force is sometimes needed:**</p> 

1. Approach dumb, rich, ignorant student talking about peace and saying there should be no retaliation.
  
2. Engage in brief conversation, ask if military force is appropriate.
  
3. When he says No, ask, Why not?
  
4. Wait until he says something to the effect of, Because that would just cause more innocent deaths, which would be awful and we should not cause more violence.
  
5. When he&#8217;s in mid-sentence, punch him in the face as hard as you can.
  
6. When he gets back up to punch you, point out that it would be a mistake and contrary to his values to strike you, because that would, be awful and he should not cause more violence.
  
7. Wait until he agrees that he has pledged not to commit additional violence.
  
8. Punch him in the face again, harder this time.

Repeat steps 6 through 8 until they understand that sometimes it is necessary to punch back.

Now, I&#8217;m no warhawk. But I do take issue with the war protestors who are basically playing right into Saddam&#8217;s hands. The link to the SNL anti-war rally skit that posted yesterday was spot-on&#8230;just like PETA, a lot of people protest for the sake of protesting, without knowing everything that is going on. Or they, like my old roommate, see things in black and white (&#8220;War BAD! Peace GOOD! Bush DUMB!&#8221;)

It&#8217;s not that simple. But if punching a hippie in the face makes the world a better place, I say it&#8217;s time we beat up some hippies.
