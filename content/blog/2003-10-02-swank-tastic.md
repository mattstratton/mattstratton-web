So last night I went to Green Dolphin. Haven&#8217;t been there in ages, and I always feel horribly underdressed.

So last night I decided that it was time to do it up right. I had this emerald houndstooth jacket I bought a few months ago, and busted it out with some other new threads.

Apparently I must dress like a huge slob all the time, because EVERYONE was commenting on how nice I looked, and how remarkable it was that I dressed up. I should do this more often.

Oh, and met a girl there too. She&#8217;s cute and fun. More on that later. (Nothing interesting; we talked, we danced, etc)
