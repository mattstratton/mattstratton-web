There&#8217;s a big fire in downtown Chicago today &#8211; [not a whole lot of information yet][1], but thanks to Flickr, I was able to see some pictures.

I worked at 500 W. Monroe for several years, and my friend Jeff works there now. Our favorite diner, the Atrium, is right across the street, and my co-worker friends were having lunch there when the fire started:

**Matt:** were you guys @ atrium when the fire started?  
**Fat Johnny:** si  
**Fat Johnny:** we came out of the building, and Jeff says &#8220;Gotta get back to work. Got some fires to put out&#8230;.&#8221;
