This was a long day.

It started this morning with my Volunteer Orientation at the [Anti-Cruelty Society][1]. That was totally interesting. Now that I&#8217;ve done that step, I have to go and get trained on the area in which I will be volunteering (Dog Adopts), and then I can actually start doing the volunteer thing. It&#8217;s pretty cool &#8211; I&#8217;m only &#8220;on the hook&#8221; for five hours a month, and you don&#8217;t have to schedule your time &#8211; you just come in whenever you can. The shelter is not too far from my office, so I think I&#8217;ll be going in after work, ideally. It was interesting to learn all the stuff that the ACS does, but I can see how working there is going to wreak havoc on my emotionally &#8211; just hearing stories today was making me tear up. Carrie already made me promise to not bring home any new dogs.

After my orientation, I met up with Carrie, <span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://brian81773.livejournal.com/"><strong>brian81773</strong></a></span>, and <span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://tavist.livejournal.com/"><strong>tavist</strong></a></span> at [Ribfest][2] (the one in the city, not in Naperville, jeez), to see the [Hoyle Brothers][3] play. I haven&#8217;t heard them in a while, and they sounded GREAT. Unfortunately, we got there a little late and only caught the last 20 minutes or so of their set. But they&#8217;ll be playing Martyr&#8217;s on the 23rd for a new record release party, so we&#8217;re definitely going to that.

Tonight, Carrie and I had a &#8220;date&#8221;. We had dinner at a Greek restaurant in Lincoln Square, and then hit the Davis to see _The Breakup_. It wasn&#8217;t nearly as bad as I had read &#8211; I laughed a lot, and the ending wasn&#8217;t contrived at all. Funny thing &#8211; Jon Favreau, in this movie, has a shaved head, and I kept seeing him as <span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://brian81773.livejournal.com/"><strong>brian81773</strong></a></span>, but with the personality of [Jeff Rak][4].
