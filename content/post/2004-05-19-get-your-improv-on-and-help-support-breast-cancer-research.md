I&#8217;m hosting an improv jam for my friend Kitty&#8217;s Avon Walk fundraiser&#8230;come on out!

**Mammary Micetro**

May 25th!
  
Cornservatory (4210 N. Lincoln)
  
8:00 pm
  
$5!!!

Come on out and be ready to laugh your little butts off at the Mammary Micetro. This is a short form comedy improv competition that starts with 20 performers and ends with the funniest one left standing.

Who can play? Anyone who wants to. The first 20 people to sign up get to play games as seen on Whose Line is it Anyway? and other great short form comedy improv shows (don&#8217;t ask me to name another. Please).

What if I don&#8217;t want to play? We still need an audience! As an audience member, it will be your job to yell out suggestions to our performers, yell &#8220;DIE!!!&#8221; when our performers screw up, score the quality of the scenes, and laugh until it hurts.

And of course, all of the proceeds from this event will go to the <a href="http://www.avonwalk.org/site/TR?pg=personal&fr_id=1041&px=1252279" target="_blank">Avon Walk for Breast Cancer</a>.

So come on out! May 25th. 4210 N. Lincoln (there are big corn stalks painted on the front of the building &#8211; you can&#8217;t miss it). Five dollars. BYOB. Doors open at 8:00pm. I&#8217;ll see you there!
