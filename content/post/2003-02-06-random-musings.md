(From [The Onion][1] this week:

&#8220;&#8221;Hey, Mr. President. When even the Germans don&#8217;t want to fight, take the fucking hint.&#8221;

Hehhe.

Anyway, some quick updates. I leave for [Atlanta][2] today! Should be a lot of fun; going to do some more [photography][3] when I&#8217;m down there, as well as enjoy a psychedelic berfday party. Plus, maybe come to terms with Gaga Girl #1. We \*are\* having breakfast together tomorrow; not that I&#8217;m going to come right out and bare my soul to her over biscuits, but at least it&#8217;s &#8220;alone&#8221; time.

Car is still acting funny; hopefully the weather will warm up a bit and it will stop being so stupid flaky so I can get to my new job reliably.

I&#8217;ll be moving into my new apartment on March 1; it&#8217;s just upstairs from where I am now. But for at least a couple months, it&#8217;ll be just mine! I do need to find a roommate though; I don&#8217;t want to shoulder that rent all by myself for a long time. Know of anyone looking for a place in the Edgewater area? It&#8217;s bomb-diggity sweet&#8230;

Saw _Adaptation_ the other night. Wasn&#8217;t as good as I&#8217;d hoped, but still a damn fine film. Nicholas Cage was excellent.
