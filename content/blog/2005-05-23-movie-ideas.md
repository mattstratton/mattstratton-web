Was talking to Chris tonight, and got to thinking about script ideas (because I am woefully dry in that area, and I need to get some shit written). Here are a couple:

1) A crime film about identity theft (since it&#8217;s a hot button right now). Most movies about computer crime are inaccurate, because computer crime is REALLY boring to watch. But I like the idea of an identity theft who actually ends up having no real identity of his own, because he is always these other people. Kind of a con man film; think _The Talented Mr. Ripley_ meets _Swordfish_.

2) Another idea came from a conversation I&#8217;d had with my friend Jamie. A movie about the guy that everyone loves, but not in the way he _wants_ to be loved. It would also allow me to play in the whole concept of wanting to find someone who doesn&#8217;t annoy you (those of you who really know me will know what I am talking about).

Along these lines&#8230;Chris was telling me about a &#8220;game&#8221; he&#8217;s been playing. It&#8217;s the &#8220;pitch&#8221; game &#8211; you know how they say when you pitch a film, it&#8217;s always described in terms of existing films (_Pretty Woman_ meets _Dawn of the Dead_). So you take two movies that don&#8217;t go together, and write a treatment based upon that. So I challenge you, the reader, to comment on this entry with a combo like that, and maybe I&#8217;ll try to write something based upon the suggestion.
