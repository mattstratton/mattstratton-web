One of my many quests of the past few years has been to discover the perfect bag to lug around my camera equipment. I&#8217;ve gone through multiple bags, including the <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BAX50G?ie=UTF8&tag=straigeyefort-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000BAX50G" target="_blank">Lowepro SlingShot 100 All-Weather Digital Camera Backpack</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Deluxe-Gadget-Bag-100EG/dp/B00004WCGF" target="_blank">Canon Deluxe Gadget Bag 100EG</a>, and my current bag, which is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Deluxe-Backpack-200EG-Cameras/dp/B00009R6TA%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00009R6TA" target="_blank">Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG</a>. However, none of these bags are really fitting my current need, for various reasons (the first two are too small for my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50D-15-1MP-Digital-Body/dp/B001EQ4BVI%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001EQ4BVI" target="_blank">Canon 40D</a> and lens (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009R6WT?ie=UTF8&tag=straigeyefort-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00009R6WT" target="_blank">EF24-70mm f/2.8L USM</a>), for starters). The Canon backpack is great for carting around ALL of my gear, but I really want an &#8220;everyday&#8221; bag that I can use for non-photography purposes in addition to my camera&#8230;which will make it more likely for me to bring my camera with me places. Here is my wishlist:

  * Messenger-style bag (not a backpack) with a comfortable strap
  * Able to hold my laptop (<a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=straigeyefort-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B001EH8GOA&md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" target="_blank">Lenovo ThinkPad T400</a> (13.2&#8243; x 9.4&#8243; x 1.3&#8243;)
  * Comfortably and securely hold my 40D with 28-70mm 2.8L lens attached
  * Room for my Speedlite and maybe a couple other random little accessories

Anyone have any suggestions? Please tell me, in the comments, what YOU use for your &#8220;everyday&#8221; camera bag&#8230;let me know what you think of your bag, and specifically, what gear you put in it.
