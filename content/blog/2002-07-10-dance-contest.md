I&#8217;m back in Chicago now&#8230;

Atlanta was fun. Amy was a great cruise director. Went to some cool spots, took some fun cheesecake type pictures&#8230;it made me happy.

In other news&#8230;I&#8217;m entering a dance contest in a few weeks. Nothing too big &#8211; one of our local venues is having a &#8220;Pro-Am&#8221; contest, and Tracy and I are entering (obviously, I am the &#8220;Am&#8221;).

These are the rules (from [Big Tyme Swing][1]):

_July 25, 2002
  
Pro-Am Dance Contest at Rumors
  
This is a contest where Chicagoland&#8217;s &#8220;pros&#8221; (teachers, dance troupe members, etc) dance with &#8220;amateurs&#8221; (generally dancers with less than 3.5 years of experience and little or no performance/teaching experience). First place takes home a $250.00 cash prize (winner takes all). Couples choose their own partners and dance in 2 rounds, one in which the DJ selects the music and one in which the couple selects the music (max of 2 minutes). Entry fee is $10 per couple. Contest will likely start around 11PM._

Tracy and I choreographed the first minute of our piece tonight (well, **she** choreographed it, and I &#8220;helped&#8221;), and I have to admit, she&#8217;s got me doing things I didn&#8217;t think I could! She&#8217;s such a rockstar. Plus, we&#8217;re doing it to a cool-ass song&#8230;I don&#8217;t want to say any more, because I think it&#8217;ll be a fun surprise (for those of you who would be at Rumors anyway). But I _will_ say that it&#8217;s Tom Waits. From _Alice_.
