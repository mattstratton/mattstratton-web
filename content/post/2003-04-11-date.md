So I went on a date last night&#8230;a girl I met at the Black and Tan improv thing.

Funny thing is&#8230;I didn&#8217;t remember much about what she looked like from then. We&#8217;ve been emailing (she originally emailed me just to say &#8220;thanks for doing that&#8230;it gave me a chance to do improv again&#8221; kind of thing). So last night we went on a date&#8230;I wasn&#8217;t sure it was a date or not at first. More on that later.

Well, she picks me up, and this girl is helluva cute. So that was the first nice thing of the evening. We head to the Clipper&#8230;get some drinks&#8230;trade quips&#8230;and end up running into Evin and Noah. So we hang at the bar for another couple hours (she had met Evin at the micetro, and we were all having a lot of fun). When they first came in, Evin said something about &#8220;we&#8217;ll sit next to you, but don&#8217;t pay us any mind, go back to your date.&#8221; Internally I panicked&#8230;&#8221;what if it&#8217;s not a date? Will that seem weird to her?&#8221; But nothing bad happened. Except that Noah and I did a shot with our pants down.

And after that, the girl was still willing to kiss me goodnight.

And today she referred to last night a &#8220;first date&#8221;. So I guess it was a date.

I like her.
