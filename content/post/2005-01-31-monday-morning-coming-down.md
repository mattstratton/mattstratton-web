In the cold light of Monday, I&#8217;m thinking this is more and more of &#8220;new girl in town looking to expand social circle&#8221; than &#8220;cute girl thinks Mugsy is super great and actually interested in him in a date-y way.&#8221;

Looking back at the previous contacts, they are ALL in the &#8220;I want new friends! Need to meet new friends!&#8221; vein. You can read everything she has said to me as &#8220;I think this guy is nifty and cool to hang out with&#8221; but without any of the possibility of actual attraction.

Don&#8217;t tell me I&#8217;m wrong. I have lots and lots of proof of cute girls who think I am totally fun and amazing but don&#8217;t want to date me.

this is not fishing. do not take it as such. this is rationality. assuming that &#8220;rationality&#8221; is a word.
