The wedding is actually, factually, THIS WEEK now. Like, this Saturday. Crazy.

I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re all looking forward to it, so that my LJ can go back to being about photography, the Cubs, and Scout. Only a few more days you&#8217;ll have to put up with this. And I swear, I&#8217;m guy. It&#8217;s so funny &#8211; everyone I work with really likes to play into the stereotype of &#8220;the guy just wants to know when to show up.&#8221; Well, I got news for you &#8211; I&#8217;m an organizer. I like to be involved. And mostly, I don&#8217;t want Carrie to be upset and/or disappointed. So I think that whole &#8220;guys shouldn&#8217;t care about wedding planning&#8221; nonsense is just that &#8211; nonsense. I also think it&#8217;s selfish and douchey.

Moving along &#8211; pretty good weekend. On Friday night Carrie and I walked down to Bowman&#8217;s for a bite to eat, and ran into [**belcanto88**][1], who was there to be trained on how to give out free drinks in a cute orange dress. We had a fun time chatting with her, and then headed home to work on, you guessed it, crafty wedding stuff.

Yesterday was a crazy day. Carrie and I got up early so I could go &#8220;practice&#8221; run for the JPMorgan Corporate Challenge 5K this Thursday &#8211; we went to the park, and she threw the ball for Scout for an hour while I ran around the park. I am so NOT prepared for the race; I only managed to run about 3.5 K. And since it looks like it is going to rain on Thursday night now, I will probably bail on the 5K.

After our park time, we ran a bunch of errands, and then hung out with Chris at home for the rest of the afternoon. Carrie went out to her sister&#8217;s house, and my mom and sister came over for dinner and helped finish tying ribbons on our programs. I cleaned the house and packed up a few more things to bring the hotel. It was quite a productive day.

Today I am going to Side Street around 3 PM for Chris&#8217;s &#8220;going away&#8221; drinks, and Carrie and her dad have a dance lesson with Julee. Tonight I am driving down to Midway to pick up Dallas and Devon, and that&#8217;s about it.

Keep your fingers crossed for nice weather this weekend!
