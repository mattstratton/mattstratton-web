Wow, what a long and tiring weekend!

Friday evening, my roommate and I decided to re-organize our front room. Took the entire computer area apart and added the desk from my room. So now one desk has the Windows PC (and, temporarily, the new [Windyhop][1] server), and the other desk has my Mac. So now Susanna has a place to do her schoolwork, and I&#8217;ll be able to sit and write (or edit) without getting into each other&#8217;s way.

After that, we went to Irish Eyes where our landlord was painting. I&#8217;m putting together a promotional video for him, so I needed to shoot some footage. He does this &#8220;night painting&#8221; where he paints in the dark with a flashlight. And interestingly enough, his night stuff looks ten times better than his other paintings.

I shot about fifteen minutes of footage over the period of an hour. Then Susanna and I went to play pool at The Lucky Strike until closing. Got home around 2:30 AM.

Saturday morning I met Andrew at 7 AM to start editing. I only worked with him until about 11:30 or so (we cut the first &#8220;green room&#8221; scene), and then headed home to get ready for <a href="https://www.trappermarkelz.com" target="_blank">Trapper</a>&#8216;s wedding. Caught about 40 minutes of a nap, and then set off.

After the wedding, we were going to go to the Red Head Piano Bar, but Backstreet and Mamalou had both forgotten their ID&#8217;s (the funny thing is Mamalou had been making fun of Backstreet for forgetting his, and then discovered he too has forgotten). So instead we headed to Mamalou&#8217;s for cocktails. I poured a couple drinks, and we settled in to watch Chris Rock. Got home around 3 AM.

This morning I was back at the editing suite at 7 AM again. Argh. I was exhausted! I watched the second green room scene that they edited after I left the day before &#8211; it looked good. Today we cut together the barbeque scene, which was tricky &#8211; we had to cut about an hour and a half of footage into five minutes. But it came out really good. It makes me happy.

That&#8217;s my story. So,<span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap; text-decoration: line-through;"><strong>mugsycruz</strong></span>, you can see why I haven&#8217;t been posting in <span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://community.livejournal.com/ljmugsies/"><strong>ljmugsies</strong></a></span>. :)
