So I got an offer from that consulting company today.

They lowballed me pretty good. It&#8217;s about $20K less than the Bank One job would be. And it&#8217;s $20K less than I have been making this last year. And about 50% of what I made at Heller.

They want an answer today. But I have an interview at Bank One tomorrow. I talked to the Bank One headhunter guy, and he suggested I tell the consulting company that I need a few days to sleep on it (which he thought was fair, especially since they&#8217;re asking me to take a pretty steep pay cut), and he will do everything he can to make sure I get a quick response after my interview tomorrow.

I&#8217;m scared to gamble the &#8220;sure thing&#8221; like this. A big part of me wants to just take the consulting job. I talked to my mom about it, but she wasn&#8217;t very sympathetic about the &#8220;low&#8221; offer, considering it&#8217;s more money than she makes :) But actually she was pretty helpful as well.
