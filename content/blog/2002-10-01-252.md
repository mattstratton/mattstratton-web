I&#8217;ve been feeling very distanced from my friends lately.

I don&#8217;t know what it is. I imagine part of it is that I haven&#8217;t been going out as much lately (due to financial issues, obviously), so there are some friends I don&#8217;t see much.

I have one very close friend who is always mean to me. I think s/he just does that becasue s/he loves me, but sometimes it&#8217;s really rough on my self-esteem.

I have some other friends who have changed. Or at least they don&#8217;t seem to like to have fun the same way we used to. I know both of them are working very hard these days, so maybe that&#8217;s it.

\*sigh\*
