I know it&#8217;s not as important as the War, or the fact that Trapper&#8217;s immune system is comprised of nanobots&#8230;

But I&#8217;m officially over Gaga Girl #1, I&#8217;ve decided. Events of the past four weeks or so have really led me to believe that I&#8217;m not as important a part of her life as I&#8217;d thought/hoped. Which is not necessarily a failing on her part, but it really helped me put things in perspective.

Now, Gaga Girl #2&#8230;you never know what will happen there&#8230;
