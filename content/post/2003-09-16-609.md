Couple bits of randomness&#8230;

Went to the Cubs game today. Went yesterday too. Going tomorrow.

Apartment is still a shambles. Lots of painting to do still.

Got a date on Wednesday with some chick from the online dating thingy. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.

Seeing Built to Spill at the Met-RO on Thursday.

I&#8217;m so very tired.
