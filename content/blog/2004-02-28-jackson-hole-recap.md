WARNING: This may be very long. And I&#8217;m really tired so it might be dumb too. You have been warned&#8230;

Sunday we flew into wonderful Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It was pretty neat; the airport is SO TINY&#8230;no jetways; we had to go down stairs and walk accross the tarmac. But it was OK, because the scenery was awesome. At the baggage claim there was a little stand with free mimosas. How kickass is THAT?

We got our bags and took the shuttle to our home for the next week &#8211; MORLEY MANOR. It was like the first episode of The Real World when everyone is exploring the house &#8211; there was a hot tub, a foosball table, and a sauna. After our explorations, we walked down to Teton Village and had lunch.

Sunday night we had dinner at the Million Dollar Cowboy Steakhouse, which wasn&#8217;t very good, but it was a good time. Exhausted, we all went to sleep to prepare ourselves for the first day on the slopes.

Monday was the first day out on the mountain. I signed up for a package deal &#8211; one full day lesson, rental, and lift ticket. I hadn&#8217;t been on skis for about five years, so I was leery of my ability, but my instructor got me going up with parallel turns. and I felt like a rockstar. Especially when we went over some jumps. I fell, but it was after catching air. After a hard day on the slopes, the hot tub was the best thing ever, even though it wasn&#8217;t as hot as it could have been. made a delicious squash soup for dinner, and we ended the evening playing Catchphrase.

Tuesday was another lesson for me, but one level up! After lunch my group went up to the top of the Apres Vous lift, which was my first time all the way up the mountain. Granted, it wasn&#8217;t the highest mountain at JH, but it was the top of one! It took almost an hour to get to the bottom, and I got a little freaked a few times, but man oh man was it great! Had apres ski with some crazy Australians and then got totally drunk at the Mangy Moose. After that it was hot tub time, which included Partytom wearing his Elvis suit into the hot tub. Did I fail to mention that he actually snowboarded as Elvis? What a night!

The rest of the week to come&#8230;
