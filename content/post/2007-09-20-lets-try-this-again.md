So apparently there was an &#8220;error&#8221;, and the Dunder Mifflin Team is making me sign up my group all over again. 

We&#8217;ve lost Gary, IN &#8211; but now I am working towards getting my very own branch in Decatur, IL. So please re-apply at http://www.dundermifflininfinity.com/employees/register/, and sign up an an &#8220;employee&#8221; of the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Decatur, IL</span> branch &#8211; with hiring code <span style="font-weight:bold;">r0067zrzrk</span> 

Thanks!
