This picture was taken yesterday when we were at Carrie&#8217;s parents&#8217; house celebrating the birthdays of Becky and Meggie (her two younger sisters).

On Saturday night we went out to celebrate Meggie&#8217;s 21st birthday. Special thanks to Chris for coming along so that I was not the ONLY male presence present.
