I really really really hate it when you are waiting on people, and they don&#8217;t follow through.

A friend of mine, and another friend of hers, told me that they wanted to see some Chicago blues this weekend.

&nbsp;I said sure, I would recommend some places, and that I didn&#8217;t have any real plans either night, so I would go with them.

&nbsp;Today I sent her an email saying okay, here are the places I would recommend.&nbsp; I went to the movies tihs afternoon, so I called her to say hey, I am going into the movies, so I won&#8217;t have my phone on.

&nbsp;She asked which night I would recommend as better; i said tonight is actually the better show at b.l.u.e.s. and that I would be out of the movie at 6, so she said &#8220;okay, I will call you then&#8221;.

As of almost 8 PM, I have received no phone call.

I just called her, and got her voice mail. I left a message saying &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s Matt, I&#8217;m assuming you guys don&#8217;t want to go tonight, so I&#8217;m going to do something else. Give me a call.&#8221;

I&#8217;m annoyed, because it&#8217;s like hey, I&#8217;ve been sitting around waiting. At least call and say hey, we are not going tonight, or whatever.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like I have anything else to do,&nbsp; but if we&#8217;re not going out, then I know I can be lazy now and just watch tv and not get all cleaned up.
