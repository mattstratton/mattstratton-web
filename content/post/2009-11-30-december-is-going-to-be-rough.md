I fully realize that today is still November, but today is the first day of &#8220;hit the ground running&#8221; for the rest of the month for me.

Usually, December is a bit of a slow time at work. It&#8217;s the end of the year, so we usually don&#8217;t have any big projects. Lots of people are on vacation, so I have fewer people to support. And everyone is more concerned with the upcoming company holiday party than with making more work for Tech Ops.

This year, it&#8217;s different. We&#8217;re going to be moving all of our stuff to a new data center this month. This is a huge undertaking, with very high visibility all the way up the chain of command. It requires massive amounts of planning to ensure that the move goes smoothly (when you&#8217;re a dot com, it is of paramount importance that your site never, ever has a blip &#8211; because that blip might just happen when Google decides to come calling, and if you aren&#8217;t there to answer the door, it could have a very detrimental effect on your SEO. Let&#8217;s just say that&#8217;s what we in the industry call &#8220;a bad thing&#8221;.)

Of course, many months ago, before I knew this move was happening, I scheduled a whole mess of activities based upon the theory that &#8220;December is a slow time&#8221;. I have Microsoft coming in this week to do a health check on our system monitoring software, for example. And while this is all going on, there&#8217;s always that minor detail of my wife being super-pregnant and possibly popping out a pair of babies any day now.

So don&#8217;t be surprised if I&#8217;m a little stressed for the next few weeks. I&#8217;m going to be elbow-deep in server elevations, migration schedules, and &#8220;what if?&#8221; scenarios. Plus all of the usual holiday parties and activities. Fortunately, we&#8217;re done with our holiday shopping. I even ordered Carrie&#8217;s &#8220;push present&#8221; this morning (although once it arrives, there&#8217;s another activity where I have to prepare it for her. More details on that when I can tell you all what I got her. Which will be after SHE finds out, of course.)

This weekend was also the second one in a row where I fully intended to finish the setup of the boys&#8217; blog/website ([https://strattonboys.com][1]{.linkification-ext}). Yeah, that didn&#8217;t happen.

Fun sidenote &#8211; this is my first blog post composed entirely on my iPhone. It was not as easy to type as you might think.

(The photo attached to this post is something I found at Walmart last weekend. I wanted to get it, but they only had one. The joy of twins rears its head again!)
