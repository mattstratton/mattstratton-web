I guess part of what is making me excited about the prospect of moving to another city is the way I feel like &#8230; alone here.

At least lately. Maybe it&#8217;s just the weather. But the only person I hang out with anymore is my ex-girlfriend. All of my other friends seem to be too busy, or too grown-up to want to go have fun anymore.

Also, the fact that I am looking to relocate has really made me &#8220;check out&#8221; I think. It&#8217;s like &#8220;senioritis&#8221;. I have no interest in trying to meet anyone new, because I know I am gonna be gone soon.

I&#8217;ve been talking about this (the move at least) with a very good friend. She pointed out to me that she doesn&#8217;t think that moving will necessarily resolve these issues. She&#8217;s probably right.

It&#8217;s also probably just due to the fact that it is wintertime.
