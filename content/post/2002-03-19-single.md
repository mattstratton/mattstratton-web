I just realized (thanks to LJ, no less) that two weeks from Wednesday will be the one year anniversary of my singlehood.

I&#8217;m not quite sure how I feel about that.

It&#8217;s kind of depressing to think about, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to affect my life much. I mean, I sure would like to have a great girlfriend. But the thing about wanting something you don&#8217;t have&#8230;is that you&#8217;re just guessing what would change if you filled that so-called void. And truth is, I don&#8217;t really have the chance to notice the &#8220;void&#8221;. I notice it at night sometimes. And when I&#8217;m hanging out with a bunch of my dating friends, and I&#8217;m the token single guy. But primarily that&#8217;s what it is&#8230;I notice it. And then I go bowling.
