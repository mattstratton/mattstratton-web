Mostly, I&#8217;m just seeing what happens when I play with Flickr and blogging, but this picture was taken in 1998 in Vegas.

We went to Vegas all inspired to be like _Swingers_. This was our night of &#8220;looking cool&#8221;. We were wrong wrong wrong. Although better than the night we wore suits and ties. Then people thought we worked there, and asked us where the bathrooms were. That is so NOT money.

Now I&#8217;m just posting to see what happens when my text wraps around the picture. I think I know, from the HTML, but I want to be positive. Because, well, this is cool and shit. Yes. Cool. I said it was cool. You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. F&#8217;real.
