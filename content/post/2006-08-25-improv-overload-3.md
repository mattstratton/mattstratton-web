In addition to the Open Improv Jam-O-Rama thingerdoodle I&#8217;m going to on Sunday, I&#8217;ve been invited to &#8220;guest direct&#8221; the improv group Playmation for a while. That&#8217;s pretty cool.

Plus, in late September, and I will be teaching an &#8220;Improv 101&#8221; workshop as part of Yehoodi U at the Y8A party in New York.

Here&#8217;s what I wrote for myself as a bio:

> Instructor Bio &#8211; Matt Stratton
> 
> Matt studied improvisation in Chicago at both the Players Workshop of the Second City, and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.iochicago.net/" target="_blank">Improv Olympic</a>. He has studied under Geoffery Baer and TJ Shadowsky. Matt also directed the improvised feature film, <span style="font-style:italic;"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dancingwithgaia.com/" target="_blank">Dancing With Gaia</a></span>, and coaches local Chicago improv groups including <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fflyingbuttresses.net%2F&ei=1BDuROn5Er3kaZKggfgB&sig2=Nu7bpC-ZL9YUqNz-dKYntw" target="_blank">The Flying Buttresses</a> and Playmation.
> 
> Matt was the instructor of the 2005 Yehoodi U &#8220;Improv for Parties&#8221; workshop at Y7A. Matt&#8217;s improvisational philosophy is summarized as &#8220;live truthfully in an imaginary world.&#8221; Matt enjoys speaking about himself in the third person.

> Matt is love.

Extra special bonus points to anyone who knows who I ripped off the last line from.
