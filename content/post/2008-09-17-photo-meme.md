This is totally the fault of <a href="http://theda.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">theda</a>.

take a picture of yourself right now.
  
don&#8217;t change your clothes, don&#8217;t fix your hair&#8230;just take a picture.
  
post that picture with NO editing.
  
post these instructions with your picture.
