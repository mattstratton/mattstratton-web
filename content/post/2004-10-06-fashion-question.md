So I&#8217;m having some issues with my outfit for Y6A.

Read on, if you want to help. If not, go fuck yourself. :)

Due to some last minute financial issues, I was not able to aquire my new tuxedo as planned.

I have a backup plan, but I want to know what you think.

I am planning on wearing this jacket:

(in case it&#8217;s not clear&#8230;it&#8217;s emerald houndstooth)

with a white shirt laydown collar and black bowtie (real, no prom date crap)

Along with some really nicely textured black Hugo Boss pants.

My questions are:

1) will the bowtie work? I haven&#8217;t had a chance to check it, because Larry has my bowtie

2) Thoughts on accessories? I was thinking really lightly tinted funky shades might work. Or maybe not.
