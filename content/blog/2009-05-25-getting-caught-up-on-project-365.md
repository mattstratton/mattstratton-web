As I mentioned the other day&#8230;I&#8217;m starting up a new photographic endeavor &#8211; taking at least one photo a day (and posting it!) for 365 days.

This past weekend, Carrie and I went Up North for the holiday&#8230;and I had no computer access. So I had to compress all of my photo uploading into one day. However, all of the days DID include a photo. I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;re my best work ever, since I did kind of rush through them tonight&#8230;but I hope you enjoy them!

**Day 2/365 &#8211; Train Signage**

Took this one while waiting for Carrie to pick me up at the Villa Park train station. It&#8217;s a sign for parking spaces, but I liked the parallel lines between the sign and the train tracks. Also, please note that this was taken with my BlackBerry camera, not my &#8220;good&#8221; camera&#8230;so it&#8217;s a little washed out.

**Day 3/365 &#8211; Traverse City Control**

This is some type of control device located on the side of a building in downtown Traverse City, Michigan. We go to Traverse City every time we go Up North, and I am starting to run out of things to photograph on the main drag&#8230;or so I thought, until I started looking for things that were not at eye level. This device was about six inches above the ground on the side of a building. I thought it looked neat.

**Day 4/365 &#8211; Sunset on Elk Lake**

My in-laws have a house on Elk Lake, which is a gorgeous, deep blue freshwater lake in northern Michigan. The sunsets are always beautiful, and this one was no exception. I&#8217;m not thrilled with how the clouds look in this photo (it&#8217;s an HDR image made up of three exposures) but my favorite sunset picture of the weekend was technically taken on Day 3, so I couldn&#8217;t use it. But keep your eye on my Flickr stream, as the &#8220;better &#8220;sunset shot will show up there when I upload all of my pictures from the weekend.

**Day 5/365 &#8211; Vroom Vroom!**

One of the coolest things about going to my in-laws&#8217; vacation house is that occasionally I get to drive my father-in-law&#8217;s sports car &#8211; a sweet Honda S2000. I got to take it for a very short spin yesterday when we brought it out of storage. Here is it parked in front of his barn. I fully acknowledge that my Photoshop masking is pretty sloppy here (I really wasn&#8217;t sure how to handle the windshield) but I thought that it really did make the red pop.
