Just got this spam today. It really cracked me up.

_Hey! I&#8217;m Nicole, and I represent over 100,000 women who are looking for guys for sex.</p> 

I work at SexAffair.org, and I basically try to help these girls get laid by finding them guys who are just interested in having sex with them without having to become boyfriend and girlfriend. Many of these women are married, some have boyfriends and all of them came to SexAffair.org for only one thing &#8211; SEX.

I am writing to you because I need your help. It must sound so strange to you, but since there are about so many girls, at least two thirds of them don&#8217;t get laid and they go to bed horny and alone. I need to get more guys to join the site and have sex with these women. I think that for a guy to find out that there is a place where the girls are actively looking for sex without a relationship is like AMAZING! Anyways, we want you to join us. These women are real and they&#8217;re ready for action.

Luv, Nichole, the SexAffair.org Women&#8217;s Organization Rep</i>
