Busy weekend coming up.

In a few hours, I will be boarding a plan bound for Philly, to meet up with [Partytom][1]. We shall then jump on a train to NYC, where we will meet and in Brooklyn for some cocktails-a-doodle (and whoever else shows up).

Saturday morning I will be getting up at the asscrack of dawn to meet George (pictured here in the lime green suit) for a 30 mile or so bike ride around Manhattan. After the ride, and I will be teaching an [improv workshop][2]. 

Then, Saturday night, is the [Yehoodi 8th Anniversary Dance-A-Rama][3]. Hopefully I&#8217;ll still be awake at this point.

Sunday morning is brunch at a location to be named later, and then Tom and I head back to Philly (with a possible [stop by Central Park][4] on the way). Sunday afternoon/evening is spent with and [Colin][5] back in Philly.

Monday I will be working out of Tom and Kim&#8217;s house, and then winging back to Chicago. Upon arrival, I will be heading directly to Fizz for [Carrie&#8217;s swing dance graduation][6].

Then I will pass out from exhaustion.
