&nbsp;&#8216;s birthday, I give you the Shana and Matt IM Greatest Hits:

Shana: she&#8217;s&#8230;not a person I&#8217;d recommend for a friend to date  
Matt: who said anything about dating her?  
Shana: who said I was talking about you?  
Matt: who said you have any friends other than me?  
&#8212;  
Shana: speaking of which&#8230;now you have me looking at boobs at the gym  
Matt: then my work here is done  
&#8212;   
Shana: Dallas is such a closet hippie  
Matt: I don&#8217;t think you know Dallas anymore&#8230;  
Shana: he&#8217;s like a homophobe that turns out to be gay  
Matt: I think that Dallas is the kind of hippie who just pretends to be a hippie becasue all the hippie chicks don&#8217;t wear bras and put out  
Shana: he hates it a little toooo much, if you know what I mean  
&#8212;   
Shana: I don&#8217;t know BASIC  
Shana: I was just making a joke  
Shana: why does everyone get so freakin geeky on Yehoodi?  
Matt: that was rhetorical, right?  
&#8212;   
Shana: but if they dated me, they must be strange  
Matt: strange&#8230;like a FOX!  
Shana: um, I think it&#8217;s crazy like a fox  
Matt: like a FOX!  
Shana: riiiiight  
Matt: right&#8230;like a FOX!  
&#8212;   
Shana: Course, it still feels like a rejection, which I wasn&#8217;t exactly angling for&#8230;  
Matt: well, what were you angling for?  
Shana: um&#8230;not-rejection&#8230;  
Matt: your command of the english language is nothing short of amazing  
&#8212;   
Shana: no more online sex  
Matt: um  
Shana: no matter how much you cry  
Matt: that&#8217;s like threatening me &#8220;no more cures for cancer&#8221;  
&#8212;   
Matt: I rule  
Shana: but I still won&#8217;t sleep with you  
Matt: I think we&#8217;ve established that  
Shana: just checking  
Matt: you know&#8230;talking to you does wonders for my self-esteem  
&#8212;   
Shana: YAY! Matt!!!!  
Matt: my own personal shana cheerleader  
Shana: 2-4-6-&#8230;.wait, what comes after 6?  
Matt: putting out  
Shana: of course!  
Shana: I forgot to remember that  
Matt: that&#8217;s why you are not a good cheerleader  
&#8212;   
Matt: hey, you are not allowed to make comments about my sexual inadequecies without field knowledge  
Shana: well then, bring it on!  
Shana: (there&#8217;s a great pick up line&#8230;remember that)  
Matt: which one?  
Matt: &#8220;bring it on&#8221;?  
Shana: no, your line  
Shana: but if you&#8217;re talking to a guy, &#8220;bring it on&#8221; works just as well  
Matt: true  
Matt: if you&#8217;re talking to a guy, &#8220;Hey! You&#8217;re standing on my foot!&#8221; works just as well  
&#8212;  
Shana: [He] might also be horrified to know that there will be no cake, church, officiant, garter, bouquet toss, obedience, God, or jordan almonds  
Matt: I hate jordan almonds  
Shana: I hate obedience  
&#8212;  
Matt: same with craig t nelson  
Shana: who?  
Matt: he played bob  
Matt: he was &#8220;coach&#8221;  
Shana: on what show?  
Matt: &#8220;coach&#8221;  
&#8212;  
Shana: you can&#8217;t judge her by your standards  
Shana: you are clearly screwed up
