House-hunting is (almost) officially over. Last week we made an offer on [the Blackhawk House][1], and it was accepted on Sunday. Today we met with our realtor to sign some more paperwork and pony up the earnest money. We&#8217;re still lender-shopping (although we have to officially apply for our loan by next Tuesday) and the home inspection is on Thursday.

We&#8217;re shooting for a late September closing date. Time to start packing!
