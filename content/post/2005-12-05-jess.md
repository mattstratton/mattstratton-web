Continuing the theme of &#8220;playing with Photoshop&#8221;, here&#8217;s one I did of my friend Jess.

The original photo can be seen [here][1].

This was just color correction &#8211; plus I over-saturated the hair and irises, and added magenta to the lips. Then I multipled a Gaussian blur over the image to get the soft glow, and tweaked the brightness/contrast.

      This one is mostly more experimenting with layer masks &#8211; using various hue/saturation adjustment layers. Plus the good ol&#8217; <a href="http://www.dooce.com/archives/photos/01_31_2003.html">Dooce Effect</a>.
