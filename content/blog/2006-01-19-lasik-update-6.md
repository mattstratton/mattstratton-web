So my LASIK will be postponed.

I met with the eye surgeon yesterday. He was REALLY nice, and I feel very confident in him.

However, he explained to me (in great detail, which I appreciated), why he would be very nervous about doing the procedure using the microkeratone blade (instead of the Interlase). Basically, my cornea diopter is right on the edge of what he would consider safe. We both agreed that it was better to have to save up some more money than to mess up my eyes. He was totally cool though &#8211; he said he would have his assistant look and see if she could find any special promotions that the laser company was doing, which could save me more money.

So at this point, I need to save up another $2000, approx, to do this safely. Maybe I&#8217;ll do that this year. Maybe next. There&#8217;s no reason to rush.
