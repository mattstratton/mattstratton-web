Annoyance the first &#8211; not one, but TWO other &#8220;Matt&#8221; people have had the same idea as me for a new domain.

I wanted &#8220;fotomatt.com&#8221;, but that&#8217;s taken. And so is &#8220;photomatt.com&#8221;. I suppose I could do &#8220;fotomatt.org&#8221;. What do you guys think?

Secondly, I need a new monitor. Mine is like&#8230;seriously almost ten years old, and I can&#8217;t get the color and gamma to look right. Crapdoodle.
