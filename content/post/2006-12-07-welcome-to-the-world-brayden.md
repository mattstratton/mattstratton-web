My mom just sent me an email that Brayden Jacob Andersen was born this morning. He shares his birthday with Larry Bird, Tom Waits, and, perhaps greatest of all, Matt Stratton.

He is the son of my mom&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s daughter. I have no idea what that makes him to me. Can someone tell me the technical term for that relationship?
