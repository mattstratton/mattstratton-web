This box came for my co-worker (with whom I share a cube) last week. I am expecting some software that was supposed to be shipped to her. So I opened the box just now.

Well, it&#8217;s not the software. I looked inside quickly and saw a rectangular box with a topless woman on it.

I assumed it was porn. I looked again. I was wrong. It is NOT porn.

It is a **LATEX THONG**. Says something about &#8220;giving pleasure on every movement&#8221;.

I taped the box back up and am now sitting in my cube shaking.

I will never be able to look at this woman the same way again.
