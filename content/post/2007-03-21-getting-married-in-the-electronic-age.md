So seriously, this whole getting hitched thing, in the age of the webbertubes is really difficult to manage.

First problem &#8211; Carrie&#8217;s email address is firstnamelastname @ gmail. Well, her last name is going to change. Gmail won&#8217;t let you rename your email account, so that&#8217;s the first problem. Second problem is that firstnamenewlastname @ gmail is taken. So she has to think of a new email address. I think I got one for her that is a variant, but that&#8217;s gonna be annoying. Plus, she&#8217;s gotta figure out how to do the whole migration from old gmail to new gmail, etc. Which would probably be more annoying for me than it is for her, since I store so much in my gmail, but she doesn&#8217;t, really.

Issue the second &#8211; Flickr. We both have our own Flickrs. This was fine when we were our own people. But now, we share cameras. So what ends up happening is, all the photos end up on my Flickr. This annoys Carrie, because it makes her Flickr look lame. So the decision is, do we combine our Flickrs? Or create a new Flickr for &#8220;the two of us&#8221; and keep the individual ones? Or maybe just move our &#8220;combined&#8221; photos into a Picasa web album and still keep our own Flickrs?

Now, the website. We have carriematt.com right now, which is being used for our wedding website. But I&#8217;d like to have a site for our new family. Because, one day, it will be more than Carrie and Matt. Of course, all the names I can think of are taken. TheStrattons.com &#8211; taken. StrattonFamily.com &#8211; taken. Grr.

Any advice you guys out there might have for any of these issues? Suggestions for a good domain name for our &#8220;family&#8221; site?
