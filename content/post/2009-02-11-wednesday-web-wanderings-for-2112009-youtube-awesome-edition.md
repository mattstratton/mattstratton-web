This week&#8217;s theme of the Web Wanderings is pretty straightforward &#8211; awesome YouTube videos.

First on the list&#8230;**FaceBook In Reality**


  
If you&#8217;ve ever tried to explain to someone, namely your parents, what
  
Facebook is like&#8230;well, it&#8217;s nothing like this video. But I like it anyway.
  
Also, the one guy looks kind of like my friend Scott Smith. But it&#8217;s not.

**More videos after the jump!**

## How Did I Google This?


  
Ever found yourself starting out facing the Goog with an innocent search,
  
perhaps &#8220;restorative powers of unicorn horn&#8221;, and before you know it,
  
you&#8217;re staring down the barrel of a conspiracy theory site authored by
  
Tiffany Brissette? Yeah, me too.

## Dunder and Dwightning


  
We all remember dancing to the hits of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/comebacks" target="_blank">Sweet Diss and the Comebacks</a>
  
at our junior high school dances, but did you know that they are fans
  
of _The Office_ too? This song WILL get stuck in your head. But that&#8217;s
  
not really a bad thing.

## Technoviking (NSFW)


  
I&#8217;m not even going to bother trying to explain this one. Would you try
  
to explain to someone why a sunset makes you cry? Would you try to
  
explain away the mystique of a perfectly dipped beef sandwich from
  
Mr. Beef? Of course you wouldn&#8217;t.

## Barenaked Ladies &#8211; Pollywog In A Bog


  
No clever commentary for this one. It&#8217;s just cute as hell. Plus, <a href="http://fuzzyco.com/news/hey_im_in_a_movie/making_pollywog.html" target="_blank">my<br /> friend Fuzzy helped with the puppets</a>.

## The Website Is Down (NSFW)


  
This was passed around my office a little while ago. There seriously
  
were several developers who injured themselves from amusement.
  
My team of sysadmins laughed along with them&#8230;until it dawned on
  
them how close to home it really hit.
