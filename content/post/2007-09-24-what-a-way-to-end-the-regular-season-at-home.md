Yesterday was a good day.

I got up early to help Carrie get stuff ready for her cousin&#8217;s baby shower. Also, I figured since I was up, I would log onto Cubs.com and sit in the &#8220;virtual waiting room&#8221; to try to score playoff tickets.

I was unsuccessful, but I didn&#8217;t anticipate success anyway. There were only something like 15,000 tickets on sale for BOTH games combined. They sold out in about 30 minutes. Frankly, I was surprised it took that long.

Sunday afternoon, I left the house (as I was banished due to the shower), and I went to church. Well, to MY church &#8211; the Friendly Confines. I rode my bike down to Wrigley, checked it with the free bike valet, and ascended the ramp to my perch in 525. Pretty darn good seats &#8211; of course, there was a pole, but it didn&#8217;t block anything much for me. My friend Doug was meeting me at the seats, and I got there about 20 minutes before game time. Doug was a few minutes late, which normally wouldn&#8217;t be a big deal, but Zambrano racked up 3 strikes so quickly it meant he missed the entire top of the 1st.

It was a great game.

Beautiful weather (72 and sunny).
  
Some great hitting by the Cubs.
  
Pirates shut-out.
  
Almost got a foul ball (it landed on the walkway about 8 feet behind me&#8230;where I&#8217;d just been walking. If I&#8217;d taken five seconds longer in the bathroom, I&#8217;d have it)

And possibly the funniest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life&#8230;the entire park started doing the &#8220;Tomahawk Chop&#8221; when the scoreboard posted that the Braves had pulled ahead of Milwaukee:
