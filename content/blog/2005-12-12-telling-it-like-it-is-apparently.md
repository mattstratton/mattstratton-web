Got this story from a friend of mine. It was just too hilarious to not share with all of you.

> Just got the most amazing phone call from a friend who shall remain anonymous.
> 
> She placed an ad on Craigslist saying she was in town on business and had 3 hours free.
> 
> Within an hour, 19 men responded.
> 
> She picked one she found sufficiently attractive and convenient.
> 
> He arrived at the hotel and after some booze and other preliminaries, they went to her room and got down to business. He achieved petit mort quickly and without warning. She took it as a compliment and said &#8220;let&#8217;s keep going.&#8221; After he resumed &#8216;ability,&#8217; if you will, they went for the straightforward action, and his gun went off again, and again quickly and without warning.
> 
> This time, &#8220;for the benefit of womankind&#8221; she told him to get up and get out. That it is not ok to be selfish and lazy, not wait for her, not make any special effort to help her along, not control himself.
> 
> &#8220;I sat on the bed, crosslegged and naked as he got dressed, and the whole time I was telling him exactly what I thought of him and the whole experience. And then he left.&#8221;
> 
> I THINK THIS IS HILAROUS AND SUPER AWESOME.
> 
> I never would have expected her to place such and ad, let alone follow through. She&#8217;s quite liberal, but i&#8217;ve never known her to be so businesslike. So that was a bit of a stunner. And THEN to hear she gave this undisciplined 32-year-old a verbal beat-down? Fantastico.
> 
> I have no sympathy for Casanova. I mean, if you&#8217;re going to answer an ad for straightup sex session, at least be able to deliver a basically competent performance.
> 
> Ah, isn&#8217;t the Internet amazing?
