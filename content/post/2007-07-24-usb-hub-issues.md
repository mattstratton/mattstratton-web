Dear Lazyweb,

Does anyone else have as many problems with USB hubs as I do?

I seem to blow them out after about six months. My Dell monitor has a built-in four port (or so) USB hub. I was using it with my Mac Mini for a while, and it was quite useful.

Then, one day, the USB hub completely stopped working. No devices plugged into any of its ports would work.

Since then, I have invested in a LaCie external HDD with a built-in Firewire hub and also a USB hub. Again, worked for a while just fine, but about two weeks ago, the USB hub functionality completely stopped working.

Is this common in USB hubs? Should I just treat them as disposable?
