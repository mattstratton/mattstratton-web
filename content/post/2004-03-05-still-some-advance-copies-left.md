As you know, my production company, <a href="http://www.gravytrainfilms.com" target="_blank">Gravy Train Films</a>, has just
  
released our first film, _<a href="http://dancingwithgaia.com" target="_blank">Dancing With Gaia</a>_.

The DVD&#8217;s will &#8220;officially&#8221; go on sale March 17. However we have a
  
limited number of the &#8220;advance&#8221; copies still available.

You can purchase them by visiting the super-secret URL at
  
<a href="http://dancingwithgaia.com/purchase.htm" target="_blank">http://dancingwithgaia.com/purchase.htm</a>.

The DVD&#8217;s are $20 each plus $3 for shipping. The &#8220;Advance Copies&#8221; are just as good as the retail ones, but they are a limited run. The synopsis text on the back of the case is different on the retail versions :) Plus you can get the &#8220;Advance Copy&#8221; now instead of waiting another couple of weeks.

Don&#8217;t have a DVD player? Then you&#8217;ll have to wait for the March 17
  
release, which will include the film on VHS, but the VHS version
  
doesn&#8217;t have the cool audio commentary, not to mention the fact that
  
DVD&#8217;s are just cooler.

Any questions, feel free to give me an email.

Matt and Dallas
