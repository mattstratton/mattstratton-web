Someone remind me why we&#8217;re leaving the city&#8230;

I just looked into parking at the Lisle train station. There is a five to seven year waiting list to get a parking permit. If you do not have a parking permit, you can buy a daily permit &#8211; but they go on sale at 8 AM and no earlier. And you can only buy them for that day. You CAN buy a pass earlier in the day, but you can&#8217;t do that more than twice a week.

I called the Village to say &#8220;Um, what am I supposed to do if I have to work earlier than that?&#8221; And I was basically told &#8220;Well, you will need to have someone drop you off or take the PACE bus.&#8221;

The good news is, for the schedule I&#8217;ll be keeping, there&#8217;s a PACE bus stop that is literally yards away from our house. The bad part is we just pumped another $500 into the Civic, which we&#8217;ll probably never drive now.
