More of the same &#8220;deleted without answering your reply&#8221; on Matchmaker.

I honestly don&#8217;t know why I bother.

At the risk of sounding like a loser, I&#8217;ve never had a single reply to my ad on that system (except for spam), and every person I reply to &#8220;deletes without responding&#8221;.

It must be nice to be a girl and have the ability to make guys feel like shit.
