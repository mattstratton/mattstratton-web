> On Sunday, August 27th, The [Flying Buttresses][1] and Playmation will host an Improv Open House, a free-for-all where you can get on stage and show [us][2] your stage genius. You can see what we do when we practice our games and scenes and you can join right in. Think of it as an interactive &#8220;Making Of&#8230;&#8221; video. Imagine if you were able to just jump right into the TV when watching _[The Making of the Superbowl Shuffle][3]_. Wow! What a thrill to be right along side those masters of their craft as they danced their way to immeasurable humiliation in the midst of one of football&#8217;s most memorable seasons. Finally, here is your chance to do just that&#8230;Tom is the Walter Payton of improv after all.
> 
> The Open House Melee Happy Fun Times start at 11 am and go until 3 pm. Come whenever you&#8217;d like. Watch. Join in. Order some delectable Beat Kitchen grub. Let us give you a location and a relationship for once.

I&#8217;m totally going to be there. I&#8217;ve coached the FlyButts a few times in the past, and have also worked with Playmation. Should be a good time for you local Chicago folks.
