Today Carrie and I [rode our bikes up to the Botanic Gardens][1]. Well, we didn&#8217;t ride all the way; we drove about halfway, parked the car, and rode the rest.

We wandered around and looked at flowers and I took [a bunch of pictures][2]. We had an overpriced lunch and enjoyed the beautiful day. [Rode home][3], and took Scout to the dog park. Cooked out hamburgers and attempted to recreate the Glenn&#8217;s Diner burger.

All in all, a great Saturday. Tomorrow I&#8217;m going to the Cubs game with my father-in-law, and that&#8217;s about it for the rest of the weekend.
