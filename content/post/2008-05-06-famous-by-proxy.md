If you happen to read Jen Lancaster&#8217;s new book, [_Such a Pretty Fat_][1], there&#8217;s a section where she talks about going to a book club party.

That was Carrie&#8217;s book club.

It&#8217;s pages 244-246. 

This is probably the most exciting thing that happened to our family today. Sigh.
