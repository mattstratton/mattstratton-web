What&#8217;s been going on this week?

Monday I went to see _The Cooler_ with Partytom. Excellent fucking movie.

Tuesday Carrie and I went out to dinner at Le Creperie, which was pretty tasty. She gave me some &#8220;Winter Solstice&#8221; gifts (a nice Fossil watch, a CD, a Cubs book, and a little notebook to use as a wine journal). Then we headed to Partytom and &#8216;s house for drinkage and hot tubbing. I played some poker there and won $20.

Wednesday I worked for a bit, and then later on headed to Lippy&#8217;s house for coffee and Christmas movie action. It was chill; just myself, Lippy, Kevin, and

Thursday I chilled at home most of the day, and then went to see _Big Fish_ with Backstreet and . Wow. Two fucking great movies in one week. Life is good.

Today I am watching TV and will go into work for a bit later to change tapes.

Oh! Don&#8217;t forget to visit <a href="http://www.filmtease.com" target="_blank">Filmtease</a> to check out the hot crossover action with Dallas and myself as guest reviewers.
