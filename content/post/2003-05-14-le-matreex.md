Well, despite the fact that I was not cool enough to get invited to go see _The Matrix Reloaded_ with the cool kids on Friday, I am going to go see it tomorrow night with other cool kids.

So there :)

I&#8217;m excited. From what I can tell from the trailers, this appears to be a movie about Trinity doing a lot of backflips.
