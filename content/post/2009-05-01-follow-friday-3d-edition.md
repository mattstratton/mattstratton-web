There&#8217;s a concept on Twitter referred to as &#8220;3D&#8221;, as in, &#8220;I know this person offline, so they are three dimensional&#8221;. I always refer to that as &#8220;IRL&#8221;, for &#8220;in real life&#8221;, but as @radiojen pointed out to me &#8211; in the twitterverse, every character counts, so the two-character &#8220;3D&#8221; is better than &#8220;IRL&#8221;.

Whatever. For #followfriday this week, I&#8217;m featuring folks you should check out who I actually factually know &#8220;in 3D&#8221;.

<a href="http://twitter.com/mteson" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5186" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0px 5px;" title="mteson" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mteson.jpg" alt="mteson" width="73" height="73" /></a><a href="http://twitter.com/mteson" target="_blank"><strong>@mteson</strong></a> &#8211; Marcelo is one interesting cat. He&#8217;s a fancy-pants sound genius that works in Hollywood, but he&#8217;s also incredibly down-to-earth and insightful about a multitude of topics. Marcelo is a master of BBQ and engaged to a gorgeous vegan &#8211; just one of the many interesting mashups that personify him. He&#8217;s an engaging tweeter, and by following him, I guarantee you will learn something. Somehow.

Since then, Meg and I have hung out in meatspace numerous times, and she&#8217;s just as awesome and hilarious in the twitterverse as she is in 3D. If you like snarky folks with bad-ass tats, @NoBatteries belongs on your follow list.

A devious mind who has no respect for the natural order of things. Imagine if the aforementioned lab master were to defy Nature herself, and combine a b-boy, a swing dancer, a diplomat, and a virtual world master. You&#8217;d have @rikomatic.

Not the most prolific tweeter ever, but always well worth a read. If you ever wanted insight into the brain of a gamer, technologist, and father of adorable children, you&#8217;ve got to follow Trapper. Also, I have stolen all nanobot jokes from him.

But even if you hadn&#8217;t, I still think you should follow her on Twitter. She&#8217;s always got the scoop on the latest and tiniest of gadgets, and besides being useful for tech news and reviews, she&#8217;s got snarkiness coming out of all seams.
