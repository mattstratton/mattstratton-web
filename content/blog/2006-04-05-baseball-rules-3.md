It wasn&#8217;t working on Monday, but today the Gameday Audio from MLB is totally working for me. So I can listen to the WGN radio broadcast of the Cubs game. It&#8217;s a little choppy and in and out, but still awesome.

Yay for Ron Santo during the workday!

Oh yeah, btw, Carrie, I spent $15 on a season-long subscription to Gameday Audio.
