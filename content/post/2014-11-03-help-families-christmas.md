excerpt: My roommate, Mary, has "adopted" not one, not two, but THREE families in need this Christmas. Last year she adopted a family of six, and had such an amazing experience she decided to up it by a factor of three. She could use YOUR help in making the holidays amazing for these families.

My roommate, <a href="https://twitter.com/marywallyall" target="_blank">Mary</a>, has &#8220;adopted&#8221; not one, not two, but THREE families in need this Christmas. Last year she adopted a family of six, and had such an amazing experience she decided to up it by a factor of three.

You can donate using <a href="https://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">Paypal</a>, <a href="https://www.chase.com/online-banking/quickpay" target="_blank">Chase Quickpay</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/wallet/" target="_blank">Google Wallet</a>, or <a href="https://square.com/cash" target="_blank">Square Cash</a> by sending the payments to [notcontrary [at] gmail [dot] com][1].

Here are the details of the adopted families:

  * 24 year old woman whose mother died unexpectedly. She now cares for her 4 siblings (ages 5, 4, 3, and 1) with what she makes working part-time at Target.
  * 50 year old woman who takes care of her 4 grandchildren (ages 16, 8, and 6 year old twins). She is unemployed and gets by with a lot of help from her church.
  * 15 year old woman with a 6 month old baby. Her 62 year old grandmother helps take care of the baby so she can continue school.

That&#8217;s thirteen people, with ages ranging from 6 months to 62 years.

Mary will take 100% of the donated money and purchase things like clothes and household goods for the families, as well as gift cards they have requested. This will also include presents for the kids.

Again, any bit of generosity you can offer to help is vastly appreciated. Even if it&#8217;s just $5, everything counts!
