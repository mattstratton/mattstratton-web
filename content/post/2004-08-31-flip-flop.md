&#8220;The most important thing is for us to find Osama bin Laden. It is our number one priority and we will not rest until we find him.&#8221;
  
&#8211; G.W. Bush, 9/13/01

&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where bin Laden is. I have no idea and really don&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s not that important. It&#8217;s not our priority.&#8221;
  
&#8211; G.W. Bush, 3/13/02

&#8220;I am truly not that concerned about him.&#8221;
  
&#8211; G.W. Bush, repsonding to a question about bin Laden&#8217;s whereabouts,
