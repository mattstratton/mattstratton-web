So Kim reminded me that I haven&#8217;t updated in a while. So here&#8217;s an update.

Friday I worked from home during the day (I can&#8217;t remember why, but I had a good reason). Friday night I watched a bunch of Arrested Development and IM-ed with Erika.

Saturday morning I had Peapod coming &#8211; the window was &#8220;9 am to 1 pm&#8221;, but luckily they showed up at 9:45. After putting my groceries away, I went over to Tracy and Brian&#8217;s house for breakfast and computer repair. I watched them make birdhouses, and then we all went out to run errands. We had a late lunch at Flat Top, and I went home to watch the Cubs lose to Chris Carpenter and the Redbirds.

After that, I went out to have yummy sushi with Erika, who is finally back from her Colorado adventures. We retired to my house to watch the Family Guy movie (shh! It&#8217;s a secret!), and were joined by Brian and Tracy. We watched some Curb Your Enthusiasm and that was that.

Today I went to the dunes with Carrie  and her friend Heather. The weather wasn&#8217;t the greatest&#8230;pretty overcast, but relatively pleasant. We climbed a big dune and had ice cream. And then drove home.

And now I&#8217;m watching the Cubs game. And IM-ing with Kim. So now you know.
