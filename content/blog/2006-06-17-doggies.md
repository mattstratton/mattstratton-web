Today I went to the Anti-Cruelty Society to get &#8220;trained&#8221; for the Dog Adopts program.

Basically, my job will be to take the dogs out to walk and also help the people who are coming in to adopt them.

I am so looking forward to this. As I told Carrie when she picked me up &#8220;I&#8217;m going to come here every day&#8221;. Actually, I don&#8217;t think that will be the case, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll do it at least once a week.

There were three of us in my training group, and we each took out a dog. I think, since I was the only boy, the trainer had me take out this Rottweiler mix named Rock. He was SO FREAKIN&#8217; SWEET&#8230;but really slobbery. Rotts crack me up, with their giant heads. He was the nicest dog ever though.

I also saw a beagle mix get adopted today. She was a calm, but stressed out, four year old dog. The couple who adopted her seemed really nice. I think that things like that are going to make volunteering at the ACS a really awesome experience.

Oh, and I lost three pounds this week. w00t.
