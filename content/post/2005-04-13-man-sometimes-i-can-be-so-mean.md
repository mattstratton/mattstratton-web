**<span style="color:red;">Mugsy:</span>** yeah, I&#8217;m just as surprised as you
  
**<span style="color:blue;">Arcecat:</span>** I&#8217;m having a hard time believing you
  
**<span style="color:red;">Mugsy:</span>** it&#8217;s pretty unbelievable, I&#8217;ll give you that
  
**<span style="color:red;">Mugsy:</span>** he hooked up with her the weekend before teh partay
  
**<span style="color:red;">Mugsy:</span>** she was on a press junket that weekend, so we only got to meet her really briefly
  
**<span style="color:blue;">Arcecat:</span>** ? he says he has a crush on her&#8230;&#8230;..crushes&#8230;don&#8217;t mean girlfriend&#8230;.press junket?
  
**<span style="color:red;">Mugsy:</span>** he thinks he&#8217;s being clever and alluding to it
  
**<span style="color:blue;">Arcecat:</span>** hmmmm&#8230;&#8230;..so .. let&#8217;s see&#8230;he&#8217;s known her a little over 3 weeks?
  
**<span style="color:red;">Mugsy:</span>** yeah, that&#8217;s about it
  
**<span style="color:blue;">Arcecat:</span>** hmmm
  
**<span style="color:red;">Mugsy:</span>** so I guess maybe he shouldn&#8217;t call her his &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; yet

**<span style="color:red;">Mugsy:</span>** he gets excited

**<span style="color:blue;">Arcecat:</span>** he got bryn to im me and yell at me and say that they were engaged&#8230;.
  
**<span style="color:blue;">Arcecat:</span>** so I don&#8217;t know what to think of that Marcelo&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.
