So Carrie seems to think I have too many female friends.

Wait, that&#8217;s not true. She thinks I have a \*lot\* of female friends.

So using my LJ friends list I did a random sampling:

If we assume that my LJ friends list is a microcosm of my entire list of friends, then the following is true:

75% of my friends are female.

Of my female friends, I am attracted to 53% of them.

Of my female friends, I have slept with 5% of them.

I don&#8217;t know what this is supposed to prove. Other than that sometimes I like doing arithmatic.
