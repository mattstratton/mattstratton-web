So the drama goes on.

Our <a title="crazy ass interweb lady" href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/silver_saturn76/88023.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">little friend</span></a> has apparently really gotten pissed at Jess. She&#8217;s on a rampage, and will &#8220;have you all permanently banned from both LiveJournal and GreatestJournal&#8221;. I especially like this part:

> I will make you sorry you ever got Internet access. You do not fuck with me.

But again, this is coming from the woman who claims to be a functioning adult member of society, yet is obsessed with the television show _Kids, Incorporated_. But hey, Jess is the big loser. But she&#8217;d better be careful, or this chick &#8220;will find out what shows you watch and bash the fuck out of them!!&#8221;

This is a better trainwreck than _Taradise_. I want to be this girl for Halloween.

She&#8217;s also being mocked incessently on [Yehoodi][1].
