I discovered a problem shortly after I got Tivo.

I expected to be able to &#8220;pause&#8221; and rewind everything.

It still happens today &#8211; I will be in a movie, and miss something. I instinctively reach for my Tivo remote, and want to hit the &#8220;skip back&#8221; button to catch that last line. And then I realize I cannot.

Well, just now, I had a similar experience while reading a book. I&#8217;m reading _[The Know It All][1]_ (a fantastic book about A. J. Jacobs&#8217;s attempt to read the entire encyclopedia), and was given pause when I realized I couldn&#8217;t &#8220;comment&#8221; in the book.

You know.

Like you would with a blog.

I&#8217;m really a nerd.
