My wife&#8217;s friend Kristen is getting married, and they were discussing wedding videos and such. Since the version of our montage that I uploaded to YouTube was disabled due to music copyright issues, I&#8217;ve decided to just embed it here instead.



For the record&#8230;those of you who have had weddings &#8211; did you have a videographer? If so, did you think it was worth it? How much have you gone back to watch your video? If not&#8230;do you regret not having one?
