<span class="postbody">Here&#8217;s something neat I came accross today.<br /> <span style="font-style:italic;"><br /> <a href="http://flagrantdisregard.com/flickr/namethatcontact.php" target="_blank" class="postlink">Name That Contact</a> is an online game that uses the Flickr API to show you photos from your contacts. It shows you a photo and you guess which of three contacts it belongs to. Requires authentication with Flickr.</span></p> 

<p>
  It&#8217;s fun. But only good if you have a decent number of people (with pictures) on your contact list. </span>
