Went to the Violent Femmes show at Goose Island Fest last night with my roommates Kristin and Susanna, and Kristin&#8217;s friends Sea and Chrissy (Sea is also our neighbor).

First and foremost, the Femmes rocked like a hurricane. I&#8217;m so glad I went to the show. I haven&#8217;t seen them in a few years, and they were the best I&#8217;ve ever seen them play.

Flirted a little bit with Sea. She&#8217;s hella cute, and has a very attractive Southern accent. Of course, the flirting stopped when she found a cute fratboy Trixie-male type to flirt with instead. Which is par for the course.
