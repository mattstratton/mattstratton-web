So the [Flying Buttresses][1] (the improv group I coach every now and again) has a FREE show at Beat Kitchen this Sunday (Feb 26).

Here&#8217;s the scoop:

> Next Sunday, February 26th, is the birthday of Johnny Cash. The Man in Black &#8211; singer, storyteller, torrid lover of Reese Witherspoon &#8211; would have been 74 years old. The Flying Buttresses, who, truth be told, have little in common with Mr. Cash other than being members of the same general species, would like to shamelessly capitalize on his birthday by creating an entirely nonsensical link in your mind between their improv and this Titan of country music.
> 
> Once this is done (and actually it has already been done without you even noticing), we would like to invite you to a very special improvisational tribute to The Man where little-to-no mention of his works and legacy are likely to be made. However, since we encourage audience involvement, you are all free to read Cashian subtexts into the show wherever you&#8217;d like and discuss them afterwards. Fun! In fact, the person who identifies the most spurious Johnny Cash reference in the show gets to choose between receiving (1) a secret valuable prize &#8211; the Bling of Fire &#8211; or (2) a kiss from A Boy Named Shannon.
> 
> This &#8220;insinuated tribute&#8221; improv show will take place at the FB&#8217;s new home, The [Beat Kitchen][2], next Sunday at 2 p.m. As this is a food and drink establishment, the opportunities for casual brunching and daytime drunkenness (both favorites of Johnny Cash&#8230;or so I want you to believe) will be ample.
