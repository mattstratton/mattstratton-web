I just had to share this tidbit posted on Yehblookey.

_Okay, I am just going to say this.</p> 

Obama is scaring the crap out of me.

Why? Because he&#8217;s too perfect.

Handsome, smart as hell, gave the best speech of the DNC, going to be the new hotshot senator, The new voice of the Democratic Party. He even said after his win that the first thing he&#8217;s gong to do is canvass Illinois and talk to all the people who didn&#8217;t vote for him to see what he can do for them in Washington.

Does anyone else think this reeks a little bit of &#8220;To Serve Man?&#8221;

I mean, come on. If he gets to the Senate and takes off his mask to reveal a tentacled alien, I won&#8217;t be surprised</em>
