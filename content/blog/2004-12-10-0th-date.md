Just got home from a date with a girl who replied to my Craigslist ad.

First of all&#8230;she was really pretty. Very attractive. Reminded me a
  
little of a younger version of Cindy.

We hung out at the dive bar for like four hours. And drank a lot. She
  
was already a little buzzed when she showed up (she had been at her
  
company xmas party and had a few glasses of wine). She talked a LOT.
  
But we seemed to get along pretty well. She was REALLY touchy-feely.
  
And she did say several times that she was having a good time, was
  
glad she met me, etc, etc. She also said a couple times that if I just
  
wanted to bail and go home, she would not be offended. I assured her I
  
had no such plans.

So finally, around 1 am or so, I am like okay, I have to get going, I
  
have a flight tomorrow, I have to pack, etc. She seems a little
  
off-put by this, but says something weird like &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll get by
  
without me. Well, you might have to.&#8221; She goes to the bathroom, and we
  
leave the bar. I give her a hug goodbye, she gives me an awkward kiss
  
on the cheek (I&#8217;m not sure if I ducked a real kiss or what; I&#8217;m so bad
  
at that), and she says &#8220;I will talk to you later&#8221; and walks off to get
  
a cab.

Who knows
