[CHICAGO&#8217;S RINGSIDE CLASSROOM][1]

> The rise and fall of boxing reminds us that no sport can take the public for granted. In an age where scandals in sports are occurring as frequently as events themselves, asking fans for forgiveness has become standard operating procedure for sports leagues, teams and stars. The recent trials and tribulations of Tank Johnson, Tim Donaghy and Michael Vick are only the latest examples of a long list of credibility problems that the sports world faces. Performance-enhancing drug scandals, criminal behavior, multimillion-dollar salaries, adulterous relationships and other issues are tainting, for some fans, the very spirit of what really matters &#8212; the games themselves.
