I just found out that morning that I have been nominated for a BlogNet award for &#8220;Best Technology Blog&#8221;. I&#8217;m pretty excited. I suppose this means that I should get going and update some new content (what a bad time for me to have fallen behind on posting the past few days!)

If you&#8217;d like to vote for me, please visit this url &#8211; https://blognetawards.com/good-old-rock &#8211; and register and vote. I&#8217;ve been registered with BlogNet for a while and have had no ill-effects, so please don&#8217;t be scared. I appreciate any of your votes!

Also, super-duper thanks to Christina of <a href="https://100books2009.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Stacked</a> for the nom. 

It could be confusing, but when you log in there, you don&#8217;t need a WordPress.com login  &#8211; you just need to register for an account on that site’s WordPress &#8211; you can register for one at this link:
