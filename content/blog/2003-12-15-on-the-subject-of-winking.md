I still don&#8217;t understand this&#8230;but I just had a conversation with my sister about winking in IM&#8217;s.

Debbie: do you know where i can find some good political cartoons about bush
  
Matt: am I doing your homework for you??
  
Debbie: haha no
  
Debbie: i need to make a 27 page long Time mag
  
Debbie: by thursday
  
Debbie: and i need a cartoon on like 16 of those pages
  
Matt: so how is this not homework?
  
Matt: ;)
  
Debbie: it&#8217;s not homework
  
Debbie: it&#8217;s an emergency
  
Debbie: and winking is creepy
  
Matt: what, time magazine called and said &#8220;debbie! we totally need you to do this month&#8217;s issue!&#8221;
  
Matt: sorry, I am behind the times on what is hip
  
Matt: in my day, winking said you were teasing
  
Debbie: ok so if i saw u on the street
  
Debbie: and we were friends
  
Debbie: and i was like hey matt
  
Debbie: followed by a big fat wink
  
Debbie: you wouldn&#8217;t be creeped out?!
  
Matt: that would be weird
  
Debbie: haha seeee!
  
Matt: but if I said something to my friend, and I wanted him or her to know I was kidding, I would wink
  
Matt: actually not in real life
