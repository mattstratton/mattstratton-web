[Gravy Train Films][1] will be sponsoring an Open Micetro at Beat Kitchen (2100 W. Belmont, Chicago, IL), on Saturday, August 10, 2002.

This improv &#8220;competition&#8221; starts with 20 people and ends with one. The audience is the judge of who stays and who goes, so you&#8217;re not going to want to miss this! It&#8217;s free, and you don&#8217;t have to play to come!

Doors open at 3 PM, games start at 4. Competition is open to the first 20 people to sign up, starting at 3 PM. You must sign up in person.

Oh, and it&#8217;s free.

Oh, and you don&#8217;t have to play to come. You should just come and watch and vote and drink!
