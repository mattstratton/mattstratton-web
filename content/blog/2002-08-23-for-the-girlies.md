**Fill in the blanks:** \_A nice ass\_ is sexy; \_a smart ass\_ is sexier.

**In my bedroom, you&#8217;ll find:** A lot of movie equipment (wait, not for the reasons you think!)

**why you should get to know me :** I&#8217;m damn funny. Plus, everyone says I&#8217;m a good listener. It&#8217;s well-documented&#8230;ask anyone! Seriously. Ask the next person you see on the street if I&#8217;m a good listener.

But besides that&#8230;I&#8217;m considerate, but I&#8217;m no pushover. I&#8217;ve got eclectic interests that range from wine to swing dancing to bowling to films. Plus, I cook and clean up after myself with great aplomb. And I use words like &#8216;aplomb&#8217;. Even when I&#8217;m not sure what they mean.

**more about who I&#8217;m looking for:** Someone funny and independent. A women that makes me laugh and makes me excited. I&#8217;m comfortable with who I am, and I want a girl who&#8217;s comfortable with me too.

I don&#8217;t think I can make a laundry list of requirements for who I want to meet &#8211; be interesting and different, and I bet I&#8217;ll like you.

Actually, feel free to comment on this&#8230;I&#8217;m really looking for feedback on the ad&#8230;yes, I have a personal. And yes, I said that they are no good for me. But yes, I&#8217;m doing it anyway. Help a brother out, will ya?
