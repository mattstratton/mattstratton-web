From <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/10/18/gayohio/" target="_blank">Salon</a>

During a question-and-answer period, someone says they&#8217;d once heard [Patrick] Johnston [vice chairman of the Ohio branch of the far-right Constitution Party] call for the execution of gays and lesbians. He vigorously denies the charge. Later, he tells me that the decision to put gays to death is a matter best left up to the states. &#8220;If we ever had a nation sufficiently Christian&#8221; to make homosexuality illegal, he says, imposing capital punishment for homosexuality would be a subject for &#8220;an in-house debate. There were capital crimes in the Bible, and that would be something debated.

The Republican National Committee, though, is using gay marriage to rally its Ohio base. A few weeks ago, Reeves was horrified to find that the RNC had mailed her a voter registration form attached to a four-color flier about &#8220;protecting marriage.&#8221; The front of the mailer pictures a bride and groom and the words, &#8220;One Man One Woman.&#8221; Inside it says, &#8220;One Vote Could Make a Difference in Making Sure It Stays that Way.&#8221;

The flier warns that &#8220;Traditional values are under attack from the radical left,&#8221; which seeks to &#8220;Destroy traditional marriage by legalizing gay marriage,&#8221; &#8220;Support abortion on demand and partial birth abortion,&#8221; and &#8220;Declare the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional because of its reference to God.&#8221;
