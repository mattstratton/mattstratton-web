This is a conversation had via email between Carrie and myself this morning. I&#8217;ve reconstructed it in this format to make it easier to read.

**Matt:** Some Cubs fans in Chicago whose last name is Fields named their son &#8220;Wrigley&#8221; just now. If we have two boys, can we name the second one Ryne? I&#8217;m kind of serious.
  
**Carrie:** Maybe&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;how about a middle name?
  
**Matt:** With the first name Ron?
  
**Carrie:** Ron Ryne Stratton? Ummmmm, I don&#8217;t think so. How about like Robert Ryne? That sounds nice or Charles Ryne? Hmmmmm&#8230;.
  
**Matt:** After Charlie Root or Bobby Dernier, right?
