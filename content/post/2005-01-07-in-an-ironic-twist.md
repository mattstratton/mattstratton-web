Considering the &#8220;compliment&#8221; game I just posted in here&#8230;this is somewhat ironic.

But I realized today&nbsp; that there are people in my life who mostly seem to exist to make me feel badly about myself. And I started to wonder: why do I keep these people around? There aren&#8217;t that many of them, but seriously&#8230;what&#8217;s the point?

I have a friend who is very supercilious &#8211; I don&#8217;t think this friend is that way with me alone, however, I have seem this friend be the exact opposite to people that they clearly consider to be, I don&#8217;t know, good at what they do, or smart, or cool, or whatever.

This friend second-guesses everything I do, and constantly seems to go out of their way to make me feel inferior. So why would I go out of my way to spend time with them? It accomplishes nothing for me, except to make me feel really angry. And that&#8217;s not good.

So I don&#8217;t make resolutions, but I am resolving now to do my best to cut people like this out of my life. I have too many fantastic people in my life who are good for me &#8211; I shouldn&#8217;t waste any time or energy with a&nbsp; situation that just makes me feel bad about myself.
