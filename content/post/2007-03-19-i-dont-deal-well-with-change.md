So at lunch today, I got some sad news.

[The Atrium restaurant][1] is closing its doors a week from Friday.

I&#8217;ve been going to the Atrium for lunch for about eight years. Hell, when we first started going, it wasn&#8217;t even called &#8220;The Atrium&#8221;, it was the &#8220;West Egg&#8221;. We are there for lunch at least once a week. 

It&#8217;s going to be sad to see it go. I think we&#8217;re pretty much planning on going there almost every day this week and next. And you&#8217;d better believe we will be having lunch there on Friday, March 30.
