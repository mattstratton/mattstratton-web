I&#8217;m kind of not excited about the Halloween costumes anymore.

I think my &#8220;group costume&#8221; is going to be kind of a bust. Two of the people in the group are really sick and will probably only be there for a little while, and certainly no fun while they are there. Another doesn&#8217;t like Halloween much and will not be all nutty either. Nothing wrong with either of those things. Just makes me kind of feel like the crazy nutty theme of our costume will be a big bust.

Please don&#8217;t tell A Certain Person that I alluded to her in my journal, if you figure out who it is. As you know she is weird about these things. Thank you.
