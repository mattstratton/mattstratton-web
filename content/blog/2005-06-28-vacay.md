So I was looking around&#8230;I have 18 vacation days remaining for the year. Including a requirement to be &#8220;out of office&#8221; for five consecutive working days (this \*can\* be coupled with training, etc, but it seems like it would be more fun to do a week long trip or something).

So where should I go? When?
