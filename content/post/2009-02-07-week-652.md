And here is this week&#8217;s self-portrait for my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mugsy/sets/72157612213865503/" target="_blank">52 Weeks project</a>, in which I take a new self-portrait every week for a year.

This week I decided to go with a Chicago Cubs theme, as it&#8217;s almost time for pitchers and catchers to report for Spring Training. My initial plan (which you can see in my 52 Weeks Rejects set) was to hold up fingers with &#8220;2&#8221; and &#8220;3&#8221;, representing &#8220;23, the number of Ryne Sandberg, my all-time favorite Cub.

Unfortunately, I had left my camera on an ISO setting of 1600, so everything turned out quite grainy. My solution was to use the grain as part of the &#8220;look&#8221;. I had a hard time deciding between this picture and the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mugsy/3260846391/" target="_blank">runner up</a>, but I think I made the right call.

Photo taken with a Canon Digital Rebel XT, with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007U00X0?ie=UTF8&tag=straigeyefort-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0007U00X0" target="_blank">Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 lens</a>. Post-processed with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adobe-65015634-Photoshop-CS4/dp/B001EUBSL0%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001EUBSL0" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop CS4</a> &#8211; very minor processing on this photo; simply cleaned it up in Adobe Camera Raw, cropped it, and tossed on the white border.

What do you think? Did I pick the best one?
