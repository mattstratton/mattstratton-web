So I talked to the woman at the eye doctor.

They will do &#8220;regular&#8221; or custom; that&#8217;s my choice. But of course, they prefer the custom.

The &#8220;interlase&#8221; process (where they use a laser instead of a blade to cut the corneal flap) costs me an additional $795/eye. I am not happy with that.

Dr. Rosin actually wants to see me himself before we schedule, to confirm that he is comfortable doing the &#8216;regular&#8217; stuff with me (since I guess I&#8217;m &#8220;right on the edge&#8221;). So I have a 2 PM appointment to see him on Wednesday. If he decides everything is okay, I will be getting the surgery on Thursday, Jan 26.
