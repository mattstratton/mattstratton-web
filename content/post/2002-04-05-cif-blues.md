This is the second year in a row I will be missing the [CIF][1]. Last year it took place the same weekend as [WCLX][2], and the only thing I was able to see wast [CTodd][3] doing a fifteen minute quasi-longform thing with a bunch of strangers. This year, his group Project D is performing at the Playground as part of the &#8220;Improv All Night&#8221; run. Grrr.

I met Chris (one of the other guys in Project D) at Rumors last night. It was pretty cool to have someone else to geek out with about improv. It sounds like they&#8217;re doing some cool stuff at [IB][4], but the more I talked to him, the happier I am to live in Chicago. I swear, we&#8217;re so damn spoiled in this town. Or at least I am. I should be out there taking classes at [IO][5], slurping up workshops and classes with the likes of Mick Napier and Susan Messing, auditioning for [The Conservatory][6] and The Incubator, and just soaking up as much improv as I can.

But do I? Of course not. I go to a Harold show at IO about once every three months, haven&#8217;t studied formally for almost a year, and tried out for Cons and Inc **once**, a year ago.

Lazy, lazy, lazy. Well, once the film is done, I&#8217;ll be studying at IO again. I have to talk to DT and see when he thinks he&#8217;ll be moving to Chicago, because we had talked about taking the classes together. If he won&#8217;t be ready when I&#8217;m ready to start studying, maybe I&#8217;ll just take some classes with Annoyance. My understanding is that their philosophy is markedly different than what I&#8217;ve been exposed to thus far (it seems to me that both PWS and IO grow out of a lot of Spolin, and IO has a lot in common with Forsberg&#8217;s PWS program).

Anyway, things that must be fixed.
