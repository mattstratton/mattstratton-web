So last night I was a-pposed to go out with some friends, but I never got called back with the details. Which is fine, because I was kind of tired.

I ended up staying in and catching up on my Tivo. I watched _Minority Report_ for the first time, and it was a lot better than I thought it would be. But man, it was pretty long.

I also had recorded _Goldmember_, but i really couldn&#8217;t get more than about ten minutes into it. It&#8217;s a shame. I really REALLY like the first Austin Powers movie, and even the second one is pretty darn good. This was for crap though. I didn&#8217;t laugh at ANYTHING. \*sigh\*
