I don&#8217;t want to get off on a rant here, and I certainly don&#8217;t want to be cliche, but there is a remarkable amount of hypocrisy in what the average modern female person wants from her male counterpart.

They hypocrisy is too easy. We&#8217;ll come back to that later. But the largest problem I have is that women expect us to know these so-called &#8220;rules&#8221;. We&#8217;re supposed to figure out when something is creepy, and when it&#8217;s romantic. And don&#8217;t even get me started on the female orgasm. Talk about pressure! 80% of modern pop culture is rife with jokes and references to men who can&#8217;t get their women off. It&#8217;s no wonder that so many of us turn gay &#8211; much  lower expectations. Frankly, I can&#8217;t imagine why any woman in her right mind would become a lesbian &#8211; you \*know\* how hard that gear is to work&#8230;it&#8217;s like choosing to drive a manual transmission. You claim you prefer it because of performance, or better milage, but in reality, you just want to Prove That You Can Do It.

Hmm. I seem to have gotten a bit off track. We&#8217;ll just leave this topic with the following thing: women expect men to not be complete idiots. Women have unreasonable expectations. The end.
