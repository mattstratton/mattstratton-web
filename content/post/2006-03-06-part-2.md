Here&#8217;s the rest of the story.

[When we last left our heroes][1], Carrie and Matt had just checked into their lush suite at the Hotel Penn. Of course, they were only engaged, and not yet married &#8211; the Hotel Penn is a very traditional establishment, so there was to be no hankypanky!

It was time for Carrie to actually meet some of my New York friends. We hopped in a cab and headed for Union Square to meet Larry and Roberta for dinner. Upon entering the restaurant, Carrie was in for another surprise: some of her friends from Chicago were sitting at the bar.

After a delicious meal, it was time for drinking. We sallied-forth to Brooklyn where we met up with half of Yehoodi at the Loki Lounge. When Swingkitten arrived with her lovely boyfriend in tow, he was very excited to share his latest art with me.

&#8220;Check it out,&#8221; he said as he handed Carrie and I a large envelope. &#8220;I took some cool pictures around the neighborhood the other day.&#8221;

Carrie was uninterested in Darren&#8217;s photography, until I said &#8220;Hey, doesn&#8217;t this guy look familiar?&#8221; She took a second glance at the 8 x 10 photographs, saw herself in them, and screamed &#8220;YOU DID NOT!&#8221; while hitting both Darren and I in the shoulders.

Effin&#8217; CIA, man. Cloak and f*cking dagger.

The rest of the weekend was pretty uneventful. Carrie almost got kicked out of Loki Lounge for going in the mens room with Partytom, and I said a lot of foul things to Bluesforce.

Sunday morning, at brunch-thirty, Carrie and I met up with some wacky kids down in DUMBO for delicious NYC brunch action.

That afternoon, Carrie, Heather, Chris, and I saw _Avenue Q_. Plus, a really big JPMorganChase sign.

Despite his afternoon snack, Chris joined the rest of us for dinner before he and Heather winged their way back to Chicago. Carrie and I enjoyed the Oscars from our hotel room, as well as some champagne and strawberries.

Oh, and the window almost fell on Carrie&#8217;s head when she tried to open it.

This morning, Carrie and I went to Central Park to wander around and take pictures of interesting branches. Well, that&#8217;s what I did. I&#8217;m not sure what she took pictures of.

Oh, and then we flew home. Our flight was delayed, but we jumped on standby for an earlier one, and they put us in the exit row. Sweet and a half.
