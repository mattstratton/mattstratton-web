So here&#8217;s the story.

I have a friend (not a super close friend), whom we will call &#8220;Bruce&#8221;, even though she&#8217;s a girl.

She is in the States from Australia, and heading back home.

Beginning of July, she emailed me asking if she could stay with me &#8220;for about a week or so&#8221; until she went back to Australia, because her lease was up and she had nowhere to stay.

I agreed, because people have helped me in the past, so I figure what goes around comes around. It&#8217;s always been how I think about these things.

Well, after about a week, I asked her when she was going home. She said it would be &#8220;in a few days&#8221;.

That was two weeks ago.

Finally, today, I asked her what her plans were. Apparently there&#8217;s some screwup with her passport, but it&#8217;s &#8220;getting taken care of&#8221;, and &#8220;hopefully&#8221; she will be leaving on Wednesday, &#8220;maybe&#8221;.

I told her that she could stay until Wednesday, but if it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;taken care of&#8221;, she&#8217;d have to find someplace else to stay after then.

Am I a bad person?
