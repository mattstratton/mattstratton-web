Some old IM&#8217;s from about three years ago on the subject of the &#8220;lindy&#8221; prefix:

 **Mugsy:** it&#8217;s TRAPPER that really hates the lindy- prefix, right?
  
**Mugsy:** you just hate it when it&#8217;s attached to luv
  
**Dallas:** I hate it in general.
  
**Mugsy:** but&#8230;but&#8230;
  
**Mugsy:** your IM name&#8230;
  
**Mugsy:** is LINDYdallas
  
**Dallas:** haha
  
**Dallas:** Yeah&#8230; that was back before lindy- went pop.
  
**Dallas:** When it \_meant\_ something.
  
**Dallas:** Either that, or I&#8217;m simply filled with empty irony.

&#8230;.

 **Belcanto:** i think the lindy prefix is funny
  
**Belcanto:** like how ridiculous it&#8217;s gotten
  
**Belcanto:** like, i&#8217;m gonna go eat a lindysammich, then put on my lindypance, then go to a lindyrave!
  
**Mugsy:** why would you put a sandwich in your pants?
