My old college friend [Scott Smith][1] has apparently become an arts and entertainment writer for [chicagoist.com][2]. You can view some of his [past works][3], including a [love letter to Dave Eggers][4], whom I have plenty to say about, but I can&#8217;t right now.

The site is pretty cool. They have a New York version too I guess.
