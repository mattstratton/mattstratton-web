OK, so here&#8217;s something that drives me up a wall.

I have an Internet Explorer window open, doing something important, like, say, Windows Update.

Then some other app decides it needs to access the webbertubes &#8211; so it goes to open its webpage&#8230;and it USES THE EFFIN&#8217; ALREADY OPEN IE WINDOW.

How the heck can this happen? Shouldn&#8217;t there be some kind of global setting to say NEVER LET STUPID PROGRAMS THAT WANT TO SHOW ME THEIR README OVER-RIDE WHAT I&#8217;M ALREADY DOING?

Lame.
