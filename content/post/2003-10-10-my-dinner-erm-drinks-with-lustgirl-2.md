I think it went really well&#8230;we sat and talked at the bar for a couple hours&#8230;we really don&#8217;t have much in common, but we got along really well, I think. Which is neat, but weird.

I dropped her off and we had a nice little sweet kiss. She told me to call her when I got back from camping this weekend.

Honestly, it was kind of nice.

I&#8217;m off for a weekend of camping! I won&#8217;t be back until Sunday. Y&#8217;all behave while I&#8217;m gone, okay?
