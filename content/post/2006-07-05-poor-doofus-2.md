Scout had a rough time of the Fourth of July yesterday. He really, REALLY got scared by the fireworks; he was in the yard when the first big BOOM hit, and he made a beeline straight into the garage (Carrie thinks he was trying to run away). We chased him out of the garage, and he fled upstairs. A little while later, I went up to go to the bathroom, and the poor guy was cowering in the corner. Once I was upstairs, he wouldn&#8217;t leave my side at all &#8211; he even followed me into the bathroom (this is uncommon for him). When we went to bed, he refused to leave our bed and insisted upon sleeping next to us (again, not common behavior).

Fireworks are rough on doggies.
