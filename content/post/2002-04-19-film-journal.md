So here&#8217;s the plan.

I want to keep a journal of every day of shooting. And I want people to read it. But for obvious reasons, I can&#8217;t publish it until all shooting is over (in case any of my cast read my LJ, etc).

So what I plan to do is record those entries in the &#8220;private&#8221; mode, and then, once everything is done, change the format back to &#8220;public&#8221; (so you all will have to scroll back through old entries, but I&#8217;ll probably set up &#8220;memories&#8221; for it or whatever.

To test this theory, I am first posting this as &#8220;private.&#8221; Then I will post another, public post, and then go back and see if I can make this one public.

Testing is fun!
