That&#8217;s right.

In the month of November, I will be attempting to write a 50,000 word &#8220;novel&#8221;.

I have no idea for a story.

I have no ideas for characters.

But I need to practice writing.

I figure I have a couple things on my side &#8211; one being that I have the entire week of Thanksgiving off as vacation, and no plans, so I should be able to hammer out a lot of stuff in that week.

This is a little scary. Actually, I&#8217;ll just be scared if I manage to finish it. I am good at starting things.

Not so good at finishing them.

Please, help keep me honest, guys.
