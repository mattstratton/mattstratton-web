I will be in NYC May 13-16. I screwed around too long getting my ticket, so I can&#8217;t come in on Thursday without paying through the ass.

I would very much like to go see a UCB show this time, if for no other reason than to get <a href="https://nandoasti.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">Nando</a> to lay off. Ha! I&#8217;m kidding.

Also, I got clearance from work to be &#8220;remote&#8221; June 20-24. That is the week between the Cubs/Yanks games and the Mermaid parade. So assuming I can find crash space with broadband for that week, I can now go to Mermaid as well. I am going to ask and see if I can possibly work out of the Metrotech location in Brooklyn though. We shall see.
