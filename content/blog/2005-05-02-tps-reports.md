<span class="postbody">This is my job today: </span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Peter Gibbons:</span> I have eight different bosses right now.
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Bob Porter: </span>Eight?
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Peter Gibbons:</span> Eight, Bob. So that means when I make a mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it.

I have had no less than four different people ream me out in email today because I missed 8 hours in my time tracking last month. The problem is that I am working on two different teams right now &#8211; I got moved to a new one, but I&#8217;m still doing work for the old team. Both teams are under the same high level manager. So when I missed those 8 hours, here&#8217;s what happened:

1) I get an email from the time tracking people saying &#8220;Hey, you missed putting in time for April 1. I adjusted it for you, so you are now in compliance. Please don&#8217;t forget this next month.&#8221;
  
2) An email is sent out to our whole group listing the people who missed time last month &#8211; sent by the high-level manager
  
3) I get an IM from my new manager saying &#8220;Hey, can you please fix time tracking? The report shows you missing 8 hours.&#8221;
  
4) I get an email from my old team lead, which is just the high-level email forwarded on, with the note &#8220;Please make sure you don&#8217;t miss compliance with time tracking anymore.&#8221;
