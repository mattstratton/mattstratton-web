Just got home from the Cubs vs. Brewers game.

I had no idea the Brewers sucked so hard. Cubs won, 9-1. Sammy hit two homers, and Kerry fucking WOOD hit one too.

Milwaukee went through four pitchers. They pulled their starter in the FIRST INNING.

It&#8217;s getting weird for me to go to Wrigley and see the Cubs kick ass. First the Yankees, now this. I&#8217;m going to the game against the Braves in a few weeks&#8230;wonder how that will play out?
