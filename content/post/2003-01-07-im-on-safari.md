OK, so one of the things announced at MacWorld Expo today was Apple&#8217;s new browser, [Safari][1].

It&#8217;s in beta, but I loaded it on my OS X machine anyway.

Holy motherfucking shit. This this is FAST. Super fast. Faster than Opera. Faster than most any browser I&#8217;ve used.

I think my Mac may become my surfing machine from now on. Anyone running OS X, I highly recommend you check this shit out.
