So I was talking to a couple friends last night on this subject.

I have never been &#8220;set up&#8221; in my entire life. Not to say that I \*want\* to be set up. But I find it interesting, and even a little disappointing, that none of my friends have ever suggested that I be &#8220;set up&#8221; with one of their friends. However, I have a couple of guy friends that my friends are always &#8220;pushing&#8221; on their girlfriends.

I have a couple theories on why this might be. One is that the majority of my friends have known me as a single guy &#8211; they associate Mugsy with &#8220;single guy who doesn&#8217;t have a girlfriend&#8221;, so they figure that I&#8217;m content with that, and they&#8217;re more worried about the friends of mine who they associate with being in a relationship. If that makes sense.

Of course, the insecure jackass part of me thinks that it&#8217;s because the friends they encourage to meet their girlfriends are more attractive and interesting than I am. I was discussing this with a buddy, who pointed out that most of my friends probably just think I&#8217;m asexual. I don&#8217;t know. What&#8217;s the deal? Please be honest. I won&#8217;t be offended, and please don&#8217;t reply to this just to placate my ego. I really want to know the rational behind this phenomenon.
