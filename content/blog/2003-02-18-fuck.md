So I just found out why my tax refund hasn&#8217;t been deposited yet&#8230;basically, it all went to money I owed from a defaulted student loan. So I&#8217;m not getting any money back. Which sucks, because the brakes just went out on my car yesterday&#8230;and the income tax refund was going to go towards a new car. I have no idea how I&#8217;m going to pay for the work on my car, which I have to fix asap, because I can&#8217;t go to work until it gets fixed.

Dammit dammit.
