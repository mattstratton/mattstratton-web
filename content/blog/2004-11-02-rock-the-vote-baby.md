I&#8217;m going to jump on the LJ bandwagon and post about how I went to vote today, and you all should as well, because otherwise P. Diddy will murder you.

T-Bone and I arrived at the polling place about 7:30 or so this morning. The was already a line down the street. We finally made it into the school around 9 AM, and finished voting about 9:30 or so. It was a slow process. But I&#8217;m glad we did it. And it was nice to see so many people out voting.

If you&#8217;re in Chicago and voted today (and like swing dancing), check this out:

_Tuesday, November 2nd – Swing Out the Vote &#8211; In honor of Election Day, Big City Swing will have the TV on during Swingin’ at the Studio so you can keep track of the results. You’ll be able to dance out your frustration or dance for joy! In addition, if you bring in your voting receipt / registration card, your cost for the evening is just $1!</p> 

Where: Big City Swing, 1012 W. Randolph, Chicago
  
When: Tues. Nov 2nd, 9:30 &#8211; Midnight</i>

I was the 162nd voter in the 40th Ward, 27th Precinct of Chicago.

If you&#8217;re in Cook County, vote &#8220;no&#8221; for Susan McDunn &#8211; a judge in Cook County &#8211; due to her opposition to two no-contest adoptions that happened to be by lesbian couples. &#8220;Done with McDunn!&#8221;
