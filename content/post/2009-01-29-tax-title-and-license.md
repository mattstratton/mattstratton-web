Last night, my wife complained to me about the sub-title of this blog: &#8220;wallowing in my own crapulence&#8221;. She said it was disgusting.

So I&#8217;m looking for some ideas on what, perhaps, I can change it to . For those of you who haven&#8217;t figured it out, both the title and sub-title of this blog are references to _The Simpsons_&#8230;as follows:

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">
  Lisa:  Look, there&#8217;s only one way to settle this.  Rock-paper-scissors.<br /> Lisa&#8217;s brain: Poor predictable Bart.  Always takes `rock&#8217;.<br /> Bart&#8217;s brain: Good ol&#8217; &#8220;rock&#8221;.  Nuthin&#8217; beats that!<br /> Bart:  Rock!<br /> Lisa:  Paper.<br /> Bart:  D&#8217;oh!<br /> &#8212; <a href="https://www.snpp.com/episodes/9F16.html" target="_blank">&#8220;The Front&#8221;</a>
</p>

and

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Mr. Burns: Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulence.<br /> &#8212; <a href="https://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F20.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Who Shot Mr. Burns? Part 2&#8221;</a>
</p>

In order to appease my wife and cause her to not be disgusted when she reads my blog (incidentally, this blog is a top Google hit for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22good+old+rock+nothing+beats+that%22" target="_blank">&#8220;Good old rock, nothing beats that&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wallow+in+my+own+crapulence" target="_blank">&#8220;wallow in my own crapulence&#8221;</a>), I am asking you, Gentle Readers, to help me rename this blog. And give it a good sub-title too. Please add your suggestions in the comments.
