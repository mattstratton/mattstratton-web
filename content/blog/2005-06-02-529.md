Finally.

Thanks to the sucktastic Dodgers, the Cubbies are over 500 again.

Now, if we could only arrange for the Cardinals to lose some games. Seriously, the NL Central this year&nbsp;is a joke. What team is 14 games back on JUNE 2? The Astros, that&#8217;s who. But for serious&#8230;this division is the suckiest teams that have ever sucked.
