Carrie and I went down by Old St. Pat&#8217;s this morning to cheer for the people running the marathon. We were at the halfway point, so we heard &#8220;Living on a Prayer&#8221; a lot.

We saw everyone we were looking for &#8211; although both Heather and Brittany saw US, instead of the other way around. And I think that was too concentrated on his running and didn&#8217;t see us cheering him on. I know that Jason was surprised to see us on the sidelines.

(While I was writing this, the last group of our friends just crossed the finish line.)

The fastest person was Carrie&#8217;s friend Brittany, who finished in 3:48:49. Next was with 4:01:48. Heather was next, with a time of 4:18;10, and Punches finished just behind her at 4:25:52. 

edged ahead of the pack at 5:55:58, and beat Kevin by one second, at 5:59:19.

Way to go, guys! That&#8217;s super impressive to finish. And congrats to Kevin for finishing his third marathon in a row!
