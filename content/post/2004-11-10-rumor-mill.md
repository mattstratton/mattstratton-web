There&#8217;s some wild speculation around the office that they are going to shut down our team in Chicago&#8230;but that they want to expand in New York and Columbus and add staff there. So it&#8217;s all rumor and guesswork right now, but it may work out that I&#8217;d have to move to NYC or Columbus.

This may accelerate my mid-life crisis relocation plan.
