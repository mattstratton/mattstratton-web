So I&#8217;m off to NYC for the weekend&#8230;I leave tomorrow just after noon and won&#8217;t be back in Chicago until Tuesday morning.

I&#8217;ll be staying with the lovely and gracious [Amanda][1]. By her request, I shall wear pants.

My friend Clint (who I haven&#8217;t seen since Punches&#8217;s wedding last fall) and his wife will be coming out to Jack&#8217;s Joint on Friday night to see George Gee&#8230;I&#8217;m really excited about that.

Saturday the plan is to hit some burlesque thingy. Sunday there are Top Secret Plans that I may or may not reveal after the weekend is over (all I&#8217;ll say is that they may or may not involve [Nando][2]).

And Monday is a &#8220;play in the park&#8221; day, weather permitting. I&#8217;m hoping to get some poker in as well.

Overall, should be a nice weekend.
