An elementary teacher starts a new job at a school in Milwaukee and trying to make a good impression on her first day, explains to her class that she&#8217;s a Brewers fan. She asks the class to raise their hands if they too are Brewers fans. Everyone in the class raises their hand except one little girl.

The teacher looks at the girl with surprise and says: &#8220;Mary, why didn&#8217;t you raise your hand?&#8221;

Because I&#8217;m not a Brewers fan,&#8221; she replied.

The teacher, still shocked, asked: &#8220;Well, if you&#8217;re not a Brewers fan, then who do you support?&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m a Cubs fan, and proud of it,&#8221; Mary replied.

The teacher could not believe her ears. &#8220;Well, Mary, might you explain why you are a Cubs fan?&#8221;

&#8220;Because my Mom and Dad are from Chicago and my Mom is a Cubs fan and my dad is a Cubs fan,so I&#8217;m a Cubs fan too!&#8221;

&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the teacher, in an obviously annoyed tone, &#8220;that&#8217;s no reason for you to be a Cubs fan. You don&#8217;t haveto be just like your parents all of the time. What if your Mom was a prostitute and your dad was a drug addict and a car thief, what would you be then?&#8221;

Mary said, &#8220;I&#8217;d be a White Sox fan.&#8221;
