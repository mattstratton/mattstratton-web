    Today's feed recommendation is Life Without Pants, a Matt Cheuvront joint. I've been following LWP for quite a while now, and in addition to being a major Thesis  guru, Matt's content is really the king here. He has phenomenal insights on building community inside a blog, but also touches on "big picture" subjects as well. One of my favorite posts discussed the fact that life and success is not a zero-sum game.

_<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5974" style="margin: 3px;" title="lwp" src="/wp-content/uploads/lwp.png" alt="" width="300" height="268" />Time to revisit a feature  of Good Old Rock – the <a href="../topics/rss-recommendations/" target="_self">RSS Recommendations</a>__! In this section, I share with you a choice blog that I follow in my feed reader.  For the time being, I focus on blogs I already follow, but if you really truly have some amazing recommendation, you can feel free to share it with me – but please do not suggest your own blog. I have over 200 blogs in my feed reader, so it will take me some time before I need new suggestions. Enjoy!_

**Blog Name:** Life Without Pants
  
Tagline: Perspective on Life Less Restricted
  
**URL:** <a href="http://www.lifewithoutpants.com/" target="_blank">http://www.lifewithoutpants.com/</a>
  
**Feed URL:** <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/lifewithoutpants" target="_blank">http://feeds.feedburner.com/lifewithoutpants</a>

Today&#8217;s feed recommendation is <a href="http://www.lifewithoutpants.com/" target="_blank">Life Without Pants</a>, a <a href="http://www.mattchevy.com/" target="_blank">Matt Cheuvront</a> joint. I&#8217;ve been following LWP for quite a while now, and in addition to being a major <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=210935&u=404372&m=24570&urllink=&afftrack=" target="_blank">Thesis</a> guru, Matt&#8217;s content is really the king here. He has phenomenal insights on building community inside a blog, but also touches on &#8220;big picture&#8221; subjects as well. One of my favorite posts discussed the fact that <a href="http://www.lifewithoutpants.com/words-of-wisdom/big-world/" target="_blank">life and success is not a zero-sum game</a>.

Matt&#8217;s got a really fresh voice and the comments on his posts are almost always lively and educational. In addition to a powerful social media presence on <a href="http://twitter.com/mattchevy" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, **Matt looks at his blog as a conversation, not a platform, which makes reading it much more rewarding**.

You may not be a blogger and you may not care about &#8220;building an audience&#8221; or marketing a blog or a brand, but even so, Matt has a lot he can teach you about the New Media approach to life. Regardless of what you learn from his blog, you&#8217;ll come away with a smile on your face, and maybe, just maybe, a call to your OWN action.

_<a href="/topics/rss-recommendations/" target="_self">RSS Recommendations</a> are in no way, shape, or form the result of any payoffs, kickbacks, or other such nonsense. All RSS Recommendations are based purely upon my interest in the recommended blog, and I assure you, all recommended sites occupy a space in my Google Reader. Suggestions for the Recommendations are welcome, however, no site will be added to the Recommendations until I have followed it in my reader for a minimum of six months._
