So I posted [yesterday][1] about my sister&#8217;s desire to go do some stuff for Habitat for Humanity for her spring break. She sent me this email today with more details if you want to help out:

<font face="Helvetica" size="2"><em>Hi, I am Becky, one of Matt&#8217;s little sisters. I am a junior at the University of Illinois (Champaign/Urbana). I have come to ask you all a huge favor. Before I ask the favor, I will explain my situation. I am going to Georgia with Greek Intervarsity (Christian fellowship) and Habitat for Humanity to build houses for the less fortunate. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I would be able to go on a Spring Break trip like this because I am student teaching now and some of the schools don&#8217;t have the same Spring Breaks as my university. Well, my school does, so I am able to go with this year. Since I am paying for school, I am broke (not much different than the average college kid I guess). The trip costs a total of $240.00, which is a major obstacle for me. I told my mom about how badly I wanted to go, the cost, and the fact that I didn&#8217;t know how I would pay for it since I wouldn&#8217;t be working over Spring Break if I went and I have no money to pay $240.00 out of my pocket. She offered to g</em></font><font face="Helvetica" size="2"><em>ive me $100.00 for the trip. I was talking with Matt about it and asked him if he could help me pay for some of it. I need about $140.00. Matt said he would help me (thanks Matt, you&#8217;re the best big bro ever!) and would ask his friends if they could help out. So this is where my favor comes in. I would like to ask you the huge favor of making a donation to my cause of going to Georgia to build houses with Habitat. Please don&#8217;t feel like you have to contribute anything or a big sum of money. I will honestly take anything you can offer, even if it&#8217;s only $.25. If you can&#8217;t donate, please don&#8217;t feel bad. I understand how tight money can get, so please don&#8217;t feel pressured. I also understand that some of you don&#8217;t know me from Adam, so I would understand if you didn&#8217;t want to contribute for that reason as well. If you can and want to donate however, please feel free! :) Since Carrie, Dan, Joy, and Jake have already contributed a total of $54 altogether (thanks guys and girls), I only need $86 more!!! Wow!!! Thanks for taking the time to read this and support my endeavors. I owe you guys a huge one! If you ever need me to build a house or whatever, just give me a ring. After all, I will become a master while I am there, right? Haha, probably not so much. I am truly grateful and thankful. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to go on this trip if it wasn&#8217;t for my mom, my bro, and you guys. God has proved to be faithful once again&#8230;He always does. Thanks to you Matt for organizing this whole thing. I owe you big time. Thanks everyone. We leave on the 20 or 21 I think, so I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes. </p> 

<p>
  Sincerely, <br />Becky :)</em> </font>
