This will be terse (maybe) since I&#8217;m trying to squeeze this in between a bunch of work stuff I should be doing.

We&#8217;re making progress on our exodus from the city. On Saturday we had a yard sale and got rid of a bunch of stuff. We then loaded up the Fay with boxes and dropped them off at the new house.

On Sunday we packed up most of the kitchen stuff, and then loaded both Fay and Civic with boxes (and Scout) and drove off to the new house. We unloaded boxes and left Scout in his new house while we went to IKEA.

We got a bunch of stuff at IKEA (new desks for both of us as well as a bunch of bookcases for the office) and dumped it in the garage. We picked up Scout and headed back home.

Our official moving day is Sept 20. We are hiring our favorite movers to take care of all the furniture moving, but if anyone wants to be helpful, I could use some assistance putting together all of our IKEA furniture that evening. :)
