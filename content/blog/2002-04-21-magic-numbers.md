So I found this link&#8230;

You can make LJ tell you which users match up to you the most&#8230;just hop to <https://www.livejournal.com/interests.bml?mode=findsim_do&user=mugsy1274>, but replace &#8220;mugsy1274&#8221; with **your** LJ name.

Each matching user gets computed a magic index, which is a weighting of two factors: the raw number of like interests, and some extra points for sharing uncommon interests.

So here&#8217;s the people on my &#8220;friends&#8221; list that match up&#8230;

&#8211; 17.839 (some guy who does improv at IO)

&#8211; 13.597 (junk in the trunk, baybee)

&#8211; 12.973 (how does Mandy end up higher than Jess??)

&#8211; 11.214 (well, not _too_ far behind Mandy&#8230;)

&#8211; 8.342 (Kate and I must match because we both love ninjas)
