Blame for this one.

**1. My journal is called** &#8221; Mugsus Cranius Delightus&#8221;. My old journal name was &#8220;Inside Mugsy&#8217;s Cranium&#8221;, and a while ago I decided switching to psuedo-Latin would be funny.

**2. My subtitle is** &#8220;Rants about swing dancers and ferrets&#8221;. I think it summarizes up things I dislike (swing dancers) and things that I think are teh awesome (ferrets).

**3. My friends page is called** &#8220;Dorkus Malorkus Expoundus&#8221;, because, well, it&#8217;s more psuedo-Latin, and I think &#8220;dorkus malorkus&#8221; is a great way to refer to a friend. So of course the extended list of friends would be &#8220;expoundus&#8221;. I make up words. It&#8217;s my birthright. Why do you hate America?

**4. My username is** <span class="ljuser" style="white-space:nowrap;"><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=mugsy1274"><img src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" style="border:0 none;vertical-align:bottom;" height="17" width="17" /></a><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/mugsy1274/"><b>mugsy1274</b></a></span>. My nickname in the &#8220;swing&#8221; world (and now pretty much everywhere) is &#8220;Mugsy&#8221;. And my birthday is Dec, 1974. Fiendishly clever, I know.

**5. My default userpic is** a picture of me with Swifty and Amanda at Y6A.

**6. My LJ &#8220;name&#8221; is** &#8220;Mugsy Malone&#8221;
