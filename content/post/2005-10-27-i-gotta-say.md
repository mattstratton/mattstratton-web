I&#8217;m happy for the Sox that they won the World Series.

I&#8217;m happy for my friends who are true sox fans, including Michael, Fat Johnny, Connors, and Rak.

I&#8217;m amused that so much of the press about the ChiSox winning the World Series is more about how it impacts the Cubs and their fans.

I&#8217;m disgusted when I think about how much more of jackasses most Sox fans are now going to become.

And I just can&#8217;t go without sharing this:
