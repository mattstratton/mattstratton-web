OK, so we have this system here at work for requesting access. It&#8217;s a Lotus Notes database (shudder) that is a real pain in the patoot. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s the only way to request new IDs in Active Directory, or to get users moved in and out of AD groups.

Anyway, after you submit a request through this system, it sends you an email update basically saying &#8220;okay, so we got your request, etc&#8221;. For some bizarre reason, the system doesn&#8217;t send these emails to me at my work address.

It sends them to [matt [at] windyhop [dot] org][1].

This is really weird. Number one, I&#8217;m positive that I would never, ever have given that email address to ANY system at the Bank (when I started working here, I was already on Gmail). Secondly&#8230;

WHY THE HELL IS OUR SECURITY SYSTEM SENDING EMAILS WITH CONFIDENTIAL, SECURE INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF THE BANK??!!

I have tried to bring this up with our security people time and time again, and they never seem to understand the problem. Sigh.
