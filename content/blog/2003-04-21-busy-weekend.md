So damn, a lot happening this weekend.

Thursday night Dallas came into town. Had seder at E\___ and N\___&#8217;s.

Best. Seder. EVER.

Some really interesting discussions, and a lot of wine. And some great food. Got home very late, and then worked the next day.

Friday night was supposed to have a date with J\____, but that fell through, so had the fellas over for poker. Met my friend&#8217;s new fella and had fun playing cards with him. Oh, and before that&#8230;went to see the Hoyle Brothers play happy hour at the Empty Bottle. They&#8217;ve got their four-song EP coming out next week; I so want to make a movie about truckers and have the Hoyles do the soundtrack. That would rule the school.

Saturday Dallas and I met up with Andrew at Brian&#8217;s studio to record the commentary track for the [_Dancing With Gaia_][1] DVD. That was so much fun. And I think that the commentary will even be interesting to people besides the three of us. We had just the right mix of sucking up and comedy, with the obligatory &#8220;movies are shot out of sequence, did you know that?&#8221; stuff that, by law, every DVD commentary must have.

Saturday night we went to see [Kitty][2] in &#8220;Floss!&#8221; at [The Cornservatory][3]. Very fun show. I highly recommend checking it out&#8230;especially if you think modern dance is funny. Went out drinking afterwards and had many, many beers.

Yesterday Dallas and I brought a friend an Easter basket because she was staying home. We filled it with candy and a copy of &#8220;Seventeen&#8221; magazine. Then the three of us did the &#8220;Does He Love You?&#8221; quiz, and watched the Simpsons.

Last night Dallas and I did some more writing, and he sent out the emails to the actors he wants for _Inventing: Stephen_. Yay for progress.
