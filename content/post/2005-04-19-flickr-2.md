Apparently those [**Flickr**][1] dudes appreciate those of us with Pro accounts. I caught this when I logged in today:

<!--StartFragment -->&nbsp;

_You may have heard on the grapevine that we planned to
  
reward our dear Flickr members who bought a Pro Account in
  
the early days. Well, it&#8217;s true! And since you&#8217;re one of
  
those lovely people, here&#8217;s a little something to say YOU
  
ROCK!</p> 

</em>_**1. Double what you paid for!
  
** &nbsp; Your original 1 year pro account has been doubled to
  
&nbsp; 2 years, and your new expiry date is Mar 30, 2007.</p> 

**2. More capacity!**
  
&nbsp; Now you can upload 2 GB per month.

**3. 2 free Pro Accounts to give away to your friends!**
  
&nbsp; This won&#8217;t be activated for a day or two, but when it
  
&nbsp; is, you&#8217;ll see a note on your home page telling you
  
&nbsp; what to do.

</em>You may now commence begging for Pro accounts.
