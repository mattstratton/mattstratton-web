I&#8217;m trying something different for this Follow Friday &#8211; instead of just tweeting a list of cool people that I think you should add to your follow list on Twitter, I&#8217;m doing a blog post to tell you a little more about the people I think you should follow. It&#8217;s entirely possible that some of these are repeats of previous #followfriday tweets from me, but since this is a new and expanded format, I don&#8217;t think anyone will mind.

<a href="https://twitter.com/Pamela_D" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5110" style="margin: 0px 5px; border: 0pt;" title="pamela_d" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/pamela_d.jpg" alt="pamela_d" width="73" height="73" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/Pamela_D" target="_blank"><strong>@Pamela_D</strong></a> &#8211; A fascinating person in general, I also find her tweets to be insightful and generally amusing. I&#8217;ve known Pam on and offline for many years, and she&#8217;s always impressed me with her broad range of interests and her passion &#8211; whether it be for animal rights, dancing, self-improvement, or just being a great friend. If you follow Pammy, you&#8217;ll not be disappointed with the insight and wit that she will add to your Twitter experience.

<a href="https://twitter.com/radiojen" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5112" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0px 5px;" title="radiojen" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/radiojen.jpg" alt="radiojen" width="73" height="73" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/radiojen" target="_blank"><strong>@radiojen</strong></a>&#8211; Unlike Pam, I have never met radiojen in person. However, she still is one of my favorite twitter folks (I refuse to use the term &#8220;tweep&#8221; on general principles). Despite her affection for Carrot Top, I still think radiojen has a good sense of humor. She consistently amuses me with her tweets, and her attitude is extremely positive, with just a slight edge &#8211; just the way that I think it should be!

<a href="https://twitter.com/mandapance" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5114" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0px 5px;" title="mandapance" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mandapance.jpg" alt="mandapance" width="73" height="73" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/mandapance" target="_blank"><strong>@mandapance</strong></a>&#8211; Another Twitterer who is a good friend offline. Amanda and I share a fascination bordering on obsession with all things Seinfeldian.  Perhaps her most amusing tweets come in the form of her cat, <a href="https://twitter.com/FangsMcGee" target="_blank"><strong>@FangsMcGee</strong></a>. But that&#8217;s a topic for a different Follow Friday. Amanda provides insight into the world of high-class shoe design, as well as all things yogatastic. She doesn&#8217;t always tweet about them, but she sometimes does. Sometimes she just tweets about being awesome.

<a href="https://twitter.com/ourmaninchicago" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5115" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0px 5px;" title="ourmaninchicago" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/ourmaninchicago.jpg" alt="ourmaninchicago" width="73" height="73" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/ourmaninchicago" target="_blank"><strong>@ourmaninchicago</strong></a> &#8211; If you&#8217;re interested into insight into cool social media in Chicago, you can&#8217;t miss by following Scott. Formerly of <a href="https://www.chicagoist.com" target="_blank">Chicagoist</a> and <a href="https://chicago.timeout.com/" target="_blank">Time Out Chicago</a>, Scott now works on Playboy.com. His tweets are often snarky, and almost always pop culture-ridden. The only thing I&#8217;m waiting for is a back-and-forth @ conversation between him and Richard Marx. Which could then turn into a sketch comedy show. (Note: this comment is based upon something that Really Happened)

I only recently started following hamsterkitten, but so far she has not let me down in the hilarity department. A saucy, funny, and no-holds-bar tweeter, hamsterkitten not only rocks some awesome ink (allegedly), but she&#8217;s also a very engaging tweeter who isn&#8217;t shy with the @ reply. A+
