So I&#8217;ve moved this blog off of WordPress.com to a self-hosted solution, for a couple reasons:

1) I wanted to be able to customize the theme (I used Chaotic Soul as my theme on WordPress.com, and I hated the way it showed archives)

2) I hear plug-ins are neat.

Well, the first annoying thing is&#8230;of course, I cannot use the same theme I had on WP dot com, since you cannot download it. And looking at the themes available on wordpress.org, none of the &#8220;dark&#8221; themes look great to me (although I&#8217;m still experimenting).

So I suppose I&#8217;ve got some work to do.

Also, when I imported all my posts from the WordPress.com blog&#8230;the categories and tags came over, but none of them were attached to posts. So I guess I get to go through all the posts again and re-categorize and re-tag them all. Fun!
