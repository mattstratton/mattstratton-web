I really want a dog.

I can&#8217;t get one for a while, if at all (I need to save some money and get a little more stable first, plus my landlord doesn&#8217;t really allow dogs*).

But I want a beagle.

I already know the name. S/he would be named &#8220;Ridley&#8221;.

If all goes according to plan, perhaps Ridley would be a birthday present to myself in December.

* &#8211; My downstairs neighbor has a dog, but on the one or two occasions that the landlord has seen her, he just told her he was dogsitting for his girlfriend. Maybe I could pull off that action, who knows.
