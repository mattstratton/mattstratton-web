Wearing
  
* Grey Anchor Blue pants
  
\* Burgandy shirt (yes, \*the* burgandy shirt&#8230;it&#8217;s my favorite one)
  
* Black Kenneth Cole shoes

Wondering
  
* If I&#8217;m going to die from Sonic Death Chest Cold
  
* What to have for lunch
  
* When I&#8217;ll get my first B1 paycheck

Wishing
  
* That my boys get their act together for the next five games.
  
* To lose a couple of inches before Y6A.
