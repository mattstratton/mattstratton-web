I&#8217;ve been &#8220;blah&#8221; a lot lately. It&#8217;s gotta be the weather.

Today was a productive day in workshops. The actors worked with their characters for the first time today. And I think that the seed is planted for some good work. I know that we have a long way to go&#8230;and not much time. May 4 is coming up sooner than it seems. At least everyone seems to be working really hard.
