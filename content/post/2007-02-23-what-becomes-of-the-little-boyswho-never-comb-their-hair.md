You&#8217;ll have to skip forward a little in this video to the actual song (although the stuff before it is pretty good too).

This is a great and moving performance of &#8220;On The Nickel&#8221;, which is one of my favorite songs by Tom Waits. It always reminds me of when I was young, and my stepfather would play Waits&#8230;he loved to give me a hard time about this song, especially the bit about the &#8216;little boys who never comb their hair&#8217;. Give it a listen.
