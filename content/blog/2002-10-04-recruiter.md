So I&#8217;d pretty much counted myself out for the job at Citadel (since I hadn&#8217;t heard from them in over a week since my second interview), but I got the following email from my recruiter today:

_I got your message yesterday. You are still in the running at Citadel, and they are still interviewing for the position. They have not decided who they want to make an offer to yet. I&#8217;ll let you know as soon as I have more information, that&#8217;s all I have right now._

So I&#8217;ve got that going for me, which is nice.
