So today Carrie and I went out to St. Charles for Dan&#8217;s post-Thanksgiving feast.

I called Dan this morning to get directions. He told me how to get there, and said &#8220;and then they can give you directions to the hospital.&#8221; Dan&#8217;s a big kidder, so I figured it was some stupid joke about indigestion from the food.

So Carrie and I arrive at the complex, and Dan&#8217;s friend Mandy answers the door. She says &#8220;Dan is in the hospital. It wasn&#8217;t a joke.&#8221;

Turns out he had been in the hospital since Friday night with pancreaitis. But he wanted people at his house for the party anyway, even though he wasn&#8217;t there. But supposedly the hospital was going to let him use a conference room there later for folks to come over.

So Carrie and I hung out at this party where we knew nobody for a while, but then the phone rang, and it was Dan. Turns out he was able to beg the doctor to let him come home early, so Mandy went to pick him up. So we got to see him after all.

After Dan&#8217;s, Carrie and I went to her folks&#8217; house to hang out with two of her sisters. Then we had dinner at the Bagel and watched _The Great Muppet Caper_.

I really am not sure what I am going to do about this.
