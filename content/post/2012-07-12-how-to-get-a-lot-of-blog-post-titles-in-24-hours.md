    As you may recall, I am embarking on an experiment to crowd-sourced blog titles. I asked Twitter to suggest titles for blog posts using the hashtag #mattblog, and committed to writing a post for every title.
    Today's post title comes to us from @gRegorLove, and it seemed like a great one to start with. I did have a tough time determing which one would be first, which is why I solicited the assistance of my good pal @FeliciaCago, who came up with a spreadsheet of all the topics along with her "invaluable feedback".

As you may recall, I am <a title="The Great Blog Title Challenge Thing" href="/meta/the-great-blog-title-challenge-thing" target="_blank">embarking on an experiment</a> to crowd-source blog titles. I asked Twitter to suggest titles for blog posts using the hashtag #mattblog, and committed to writing a post for every title.

Today&#8217;s post title comes to us from <a href="http://twitter.com/gRegorLove" target="_blank">@gRegorLove</a>, and it seemed like a great one to start with. I did have a tough time determing which one would be first, which is why I solicited the assistance of my good pal <a href="http://twitter.com/FeliciaCago" target="_blank">@FeliciaCago</a>, who came up with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Agc3HJT3D0F0dHRIcXh3NmZHQkFDM013aFh4d2Y2eGc" target="_blank">spreadsheet of all the topics</a> along with her &#8220;invaluable feedback&#8221;.

Initially, she was confused about the purpose of the project, which just goes to show she ignores all of my tweets:

> **feliciacago:** ugh, I misunderstood. Blogposts, not blogs.
  
> **feliciacago:** i have to rethink my whole list now.
  
> **me:** you thought i was starting 50 different blogs?
  
> **feliciacago:** i thought you were choosing the best one
  
> **me:** i think most of your feedback still applies but i am expecting you to surpass just on principle
  
> **feliciacago:** i added mine.
  
> **feliciacago:**  You should clearly start with that one.
  
> **me:**  don&#8217;t abuse your power
  
> **me: **or if you are going to, be sneaky about it at least
  
> **feliciacago:** i added my feedback as a response to your feedback.
  
> **feliciacago:** We&#8217;re creating a universe of odd.

    Shortly after clarification, Felicia decided that we couldn&#8217;t evaluate this on our own. We needed the assistance of the smartest person we know, that is, <a href="http://twitter.com/ourmaninchicago" target="_blank">@ourmaninchicago</a>. His entire feedback on every title was &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;, with the exception of <a href="http://twitter.com/KarynCarlton" target="_blank">@KarynCarlton</a>&#8216;s suggestion of &#8220;Hall and Oates: American Heroes&#8221;. To that, he simply said, in all caps and giant font: &#8220;<strong>DO THIS ONE</strong>&#8220;.

    What have I learned so far? I&#8217;ve learned that <a href="http://twitter.com/purekatherine" target="_blank">@purekatherine</a> has a lot of ideas. I mean a LOT. 20% of the suggestions came from her. Which I can only surmise means either a) she cares about my success as a blogger or b) she was supposed to be glittering some shoes and needed to procrastinate.

    I do suggest participating in this project with me. Give it a try &#8211; you&#8217;ll get some interesting suggestions, and I know that coming up with content for some of these titles is going to be a challenge. Think about it as a writing prompt, if the writing prompt hit you over the head with a dead squirrel and made you wear a lycra tanktop to work.
