I got this idea from . It sounds like fun. Or, at least, it sounds like a way to be elitist and snobby, and we love that!

Here&#8217;s how this will work: you hit shuffle on your iPod, write down the first 10 songs you come up with, and submit them here as a comment (screened).The lists will be posted as a poll tomorrow AM, and then we unleash the dogs of war.

came up with a very complicated and mathematic method of scoring, but it is a lot more numbers than I can handle, so we&#8217;ll just do it by a tricky method of &#8220;good&#8221; vs. &#8220;crap&#8221;, or &#8220;awesome&#8221; vs. &#8220;less awesome&#8221;.

Off we go!
