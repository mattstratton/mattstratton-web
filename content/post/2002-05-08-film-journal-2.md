Some of you know I&#8217;m keeping a journal of my Dancing With Gaia experiences.

Most of the entries are private for now, but will be published out when the picture is completed.

But every now and again, I mark one public.

Try checking it out [here][1].

And if you want to see some input from the &#8220;other side&#8221;, check out Fuzzy&#8217;s [&#8220;Hey-I&#8217;m-in-a-Movie journal&#8221;][2].

For those of you who can&#8217;t wait, here&#8217;s a picture from Day One of shooting:
