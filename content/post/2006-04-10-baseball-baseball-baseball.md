Man, last night was a good game. Our seats weren&#8217;t the greatest (last row of the Terrace Reserved, so the upper deck blocks a LOT of fly balls and the whole scoreboard), but it was well worth it. Nail-biter of a game, and while the Cubs did win it on a long ball (a REALLY long ball&#8230;grand slam out onto Waveland), it was nice to see the Redbirds sent home with their tailfeathers between their legs.

Upcoming games for Mugsy:

Thursday, April 13, vs. Cincinatti
