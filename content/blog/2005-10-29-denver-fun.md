I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;m up right now, other than the fact that the sun came up, so it&#8217;s hard to sleep.

Last night was a lot of fun. Went to the annual Halloween dance here in Denver with , Kelli, and Greg. Didn&#8217;t have a wheelchair for my Dr. Strangelove costume, but decided that I would be even more obscure, and told some people that I was dressed as &#8220;Mr. Igoe&#8221; from _Innerspace_. Nobody really got that.

After the dance was over, we went clubbing. The first place we went to, Tracks, was supposed to be a gay club, but apparently last night it was a hip hop club. Someone got our money back, and we went to a place called Everest, which was DEFINTELY a gay club. Did some good dancing (I was VERY out of place in my costume; I figured if anyone asked, I would tell them I was dressed as a Republican) and eventually Kelly, Greg, Kathy, and I retired back to Kathy&#8217;s house, where we stayed up until 4:30 AM listening to Z-Trip and reading Tarot cards. Fun times.
