So I didn&#8217;t know this&#8230;you can make your [Friend Groups][1] used for filtering display&#8230;not just for security.

You simply use this url &#8211; [http://www.livejournal.com/][2]{.linkification-ext}**username**/friends/**groupname**

(where &#8220;username&#8221; is your LJ username, and &#8220;groupname&#8221; is the name of the group.)

If you want other people to be able to use those filtered pages, make sure you set the group to &#8220;public&#8221; (by default, it is &#8220;private&#8221;).

Here are a couple ones I created:

[Just Friends][3] &#8211; only lists actual \*accounts\*&#8230;no communities show up in this one.

Buffy Stuff &#8211; couple Buffy communities, as well as the Sunnydale Sock Puppets.

Lindy Hop &#8211; LJ people involved in the swing scene.

[My Communities][4] &#8211; just posts from the various communities I watch.
