So yesterday I got the following email:

> _Matt, CSIRT received the alert below showing that you used AOL chat from the JPMC infrastructure. Use of external instant messaging and webmail are violations of the IT Control Policies due to the inherent security risks involved._
> 
> _Additionally, the firm&#8217;s workstation inventory system shows your machine has several unauthorized software programs installed, including games, chat clients, iTunes, Google and Yahoo utilities, multimedia programs, etc. The full list of questionable programs is pasted below and in the attached file for your reference._

So, first of all, this means that no more IM-ing from work. So if you need to talk to me, email me on Gmail (I can get that on my BlackBerry). I&#8217;m also annoyed that they made me uninstall iTunes, but I don&#8217;t really use it at work, so whatever. The really annoying thing is that they want me to uninstall PINS (password management tool) and Magic ISO Maker (I use this to create floppy disk images for remote media mounting on HP RiLO boards).

I uninstalled everything except PINS, because, well, I need it.
