I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s September already. This summer really went too quickly. Of course, I think we say that every September.

So what did August hold for me?

## VEDA

As you are aware, in the month of August I participated in VEDA &#8211; Vlog Every Day in August. I even managed to almost do it every day. If you&#8217;d like to check out my VEDA videos, you can find them on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL20722ABC7A7D3679&feature=viewall" target="_blank">this YouTube playlist</a>.

It was a pretty cool project to attempt. It was a lot of fun to make myself think of different ways to present video content, and I certainly got to know a lot of my fellow participants a lot better, just by having the peeks into their worlds via their vlogs. And I got to sync up and connect with my old pal <a href="https://dailykitty.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Kitty</a> again, which was pretty much awesome.

I also got to meet a bunch of the VEDA folks in &#8220;real life&#8221; when they were in town for the 20SB Summit. I would say that hanging out IRL with folks like <a href="https://www.purekatherine.com" target="_blank">Katherine</a>, <a href="https://www.nicopolitan.com" target="_blank">Nico</a>, <a href="https://www.rachelskirts.com" target="_blank">Rachel</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dmbosstone" target="_blank">Patrick</a> for the first time was a major highlight of the month.

## Work Stuff

August was a busy time for me, work-wise. We kicked off some of our pilots for our Agile transformation, which is both exciting and terrifying at the same time. I also brought on an additional team member, who I &#8220;stole&#8221; from our Corporate Technology group, and he&#8217;s been a great asset to our team. I&#8217;ve been here for almost four years, and it&#8217;s interesting to think about the changes since I started &#8211; for example, when I came on board in November of 2007, my team consisted of myself and one sys admin. Today I manage a team of five, and the scope of that team has increased as well.

## Baby Girl Stratton

She didn&#8217;t show up in August. We suspect she will be here in September. She also should get a name at some point.

## Henry and Joey

We actually wrote up a <a href="https://strattonboys.com/henry-and-joey-20-months-old" target="_blank">blog post</a> about them in August. That&#8217;s something we haven&#8217;t done for a long time. So go <a href="https://strattonboys.com/henry-and-joey-20-months-old" target="_blank">check it out</a>.
