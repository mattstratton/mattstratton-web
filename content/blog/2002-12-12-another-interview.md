So I had an interview yesterday with [Mosaic Infoforce][1] to be a network engineer.

I think the interview went well. Seemed to have a good rapport with the guy who would be my boss. They are interviewing three other people, and I am supposed to hear back on Monday.

I really hope I get this. It looks like a good fit; nothing to stressful, but I&#8217;d keep busy.
