Today my boss and I went to the Cubs/Nationals game at Wrigley. We were in super pimp seats in the FIRST ROW right behind first base. Turns out my friend Alan (pictured here) is now working on-field security at Wrigley. Too cool. The game was great, although the Cubs lost. I got to lean on the brick wall next to the field, and if I wanted to, could have reached down and touched the field. Nifty.
