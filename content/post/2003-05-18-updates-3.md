First update &#8211; I hate my job. I really need a new one. The location sucks, the job is boring as all hell (if I stay in it for too long I will stagnate and it will be even harder to find a new job), and the people suck. They&#8217;re boring and my boss is kind of a jackass.

So I updated my resume today online, and applied for a bunch of jobs downtown. Hopefully one of them will pan out.

Weekend was pretty good I guess. Went to the folks&#8217; house on Saturday for belated Mothers Day&#8230;my sister and I got my mom a digital camera a birthday/mom&#8217;s day gift. She seems to really like it. Came home Saturday night and went to Exit with the kids&#8230;got home around 3:30 am and have been paying for it all day.

Today didn&#8217;t do much productive. Watched _Cruel Intentions 2_ on my Tivo (it sucked), and then went to grill out at Tracy&#8217;s house with her and Chris. Which was fun and nice. But I am freakin&#8217; beat.

Can&#8217;t wait for NYC this weekend.
