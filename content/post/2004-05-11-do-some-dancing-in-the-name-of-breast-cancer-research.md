This Friday, my good friends <a href="http://dailykitty.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Kitty</a> and Tessa are hosting a kick ass benefit for the <a href="http://www.avonwalk.org/site/TR?pg=personal&fr_id=1041&px=1252279" target="_blank">Avon Walk for Breast Cancer</a> at the Jefferson Tap, featuring Lesley Byers and the Jazz Cats.

_**Under the Wire Fundraising Benefit**_

_Friday, May 14th
  
Jefferson Tap (325 N. Jefferson, Chicago, IL)
  
8:00pm
  
$20_

_Lesley Byers and the Jazz Cats will be playing an evening of totally danceable music at the Jefferson Tap to help Tessa and I in our fundraising efforts. We&#8217;ve got silent auction items (thanks to everyone who donated stuff for this!), raffle items, door prizes, and just an all around fun evening planned. You&#8217;re not going to want to miss this! Even if you don&#8217;t dance &#8212; the Tap has great food and a cute bartender, so come on out and just have fun as we try to find a cure for breast cancer._

Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend this, but if you&#8217;re in the area, you should check it out. It sounds like it will be a lot of fun.
