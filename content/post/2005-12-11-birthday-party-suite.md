So tonight (well, I guess it&#8217;s &#8220;last night&#8221;, since it is now Sunday morning), I met up with some great friends at Suite to celebrate my birthday.

This is one of the pictures I took of <. I like it; especially the background. There were about a billion other pictures taken tonight, but they are all on Carrie&#8217;s camera, so I&#8217;ll get them tomorrow.
