If you&#8217;ve been wondering why there&#8217;s been a marked lack of content here at the Rock lately, I have what I consider to be a very good excuse.

On Wednesday, Dec 30, my lovely wife Carrie gave birth to our two awesome new sons, Henry Phillip and Joseph Steven.

I&#8217;ve been blogging a lot over at <a href="http://strattonboys.com" target="_blank">http://strattonboys.com</a>, which is the site I set up for updates about the two guys. I recommend you take a visit over there for all the details, but in case one Stratton website is your limit, I&#8217;ll give you some updates and info here.

Henry and Joey were born slightly early &#8211; they were delivered at 35 weeks and 5 days. This was determined to be necessary as Carrie was diagnosed with preclampsia, which can be a very severe condition. The doctors decided that the risk to her health was greater than the benefits of the boys staying in utero. So out they came.

Both boys came out pretty healthy, despite being born early. Carrie spent five days in the hospital recovering from a C-section, but only Henry got to come home with us at first. Joey was having difficulty with his breathing (he was respirating too quickly and too shallowly at first), but fortunately he was able to come home with us yesterday (a little over a week after his brother came home).

We are a full family finally. It feels good.
