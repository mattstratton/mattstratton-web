That stupid jingle is stuck in my head.

So things look good with B1. The recruiter called me today to double-check something from the result of my background check, which I confirmed, and he said &#8220;everything looks good&#8221;. He sent my offer letter overnight today, so I should get it tomorrow.

My first &#8220;official&#8221; day is next Monday, although until they get my replacement, I&#8217;ll still be doing the same job. So that&#8217;s good.

I leave for NYC in three days. Awesomeness.

I&#8217;m looking forward to the trip. Lots of fun packed into three days. Looking forward to seeing old friends, meeting new ones, and introducing partytom to people who haven&#8217;t been exposed to him yet.

(yes, , I said &#8220;exposed&#8221;)
