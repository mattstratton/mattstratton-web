It&#8217;s a slow Friday.

I was super duper busy in the morning, but after lunch (which was a long one; we walked down to Millennium Park and had sandwiches while listening to an orchestra rehearse) I&#8217;ve had little to do. Everyone is out this afternoon (we don&#8217;t have official &#8220;summer hours&#8221; at the Bank, but pretty much everyone works from home on Fridays and is impossible to get a hold of after 1 pm or so)

This evening, Carrie and I are going to babysit for Sam (

Tomorrow during the day I am backing up our on-call person, so I am under &#8220;house arrest&#8221;, but in the evening we&#8217;re heading out to <strike>the boonies</strike> Algonquin for a summery cocktail party at my sister-in-law&#8217;s house (actually, it&#8217;s also my brother-in-law&#8217;s house&#8230;how do you refer to both of them together? my sister-and-brother-in-law?)

Sunday is laundry day.

Next weekend Carrie, Scout, and I are going to go camping to break in our new gear we got for the wedding. And then after that, we head Up North for a week. Yay.
