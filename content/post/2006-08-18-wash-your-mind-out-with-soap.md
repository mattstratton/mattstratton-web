So yeah, today was the day.

I begged and pleaded, and got someone to cover my on-call for a few hours this afternoon, in order to go and see Snakes on a Plane.

I was disappointed with the crowd &#8211; I wanted to see the flick on opening day, hoping to have a good crowd of similarly-minded viewers. But since Jeff and I had to catch the 2:30 PM show, there were only about 30 people in the audience. But the two of us still laughed a lot.

It was exactly what was promised. Snakes. On a plane. No real plot to speak of &#8211; it was simply a device to put some snakes on a plane. And to have Sammy Jack kill them in various ways, after they basically bite people in just about every bodily part imaginable.

Plenty of good laughs, but mostly you&#8217;re laughing at the movie itself. But it&#8217;s plenty self-aware, and ripe with cliches. 

And Samuel L. Jackson does something particularly hilarious at the end.

I thought I had a picture of a snake from my zoo trip, but I don&#8217;t, so this lizard will have to do.
