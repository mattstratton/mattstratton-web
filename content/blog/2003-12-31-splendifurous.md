Yesterday turned out to be a pretty busy day.

In the afternoon, I went window-shopping with Partytom. We stopped by a ski/snowboard shop to look at gear. That shit ain&#8217;t cheap, yo! But we&#8217;re going to rent from that shop this weekend when we go on a practice trip before Jackson Hole in Feb.

After that, we rented _Josie and the Pussycats_, and watched that while eating dinner. Tom had not seen the movie before and cracked up. Seriously, that&#8217;s a great movie &#8211; I know you probably think it is dumb. I did before I saw it.

One of my favorite exchanges:
  
_**Alexander:** You know what? I still don&#8217;t understand why you&#8217;re here.
  
**Alexandra:** I&#8217;m here because I was in the comic book
  
**Alexander:** What?
  
**Alexandra:** Nothing._

After that rockin&#8217; good time, I went to do karaoke with Erika and T-Dawg, aka Hot Dan, who I knew in college, but haven&#8217;t seen in like forever. I showed up and T-Dawg was up on stage singing Led Zepplin&#8230;it was painful, even though he&#8217;s a big opera star. I think it was intentionally painful.

I was convinced to do some singing myself. I have never done it before (that I can recall). I sang &#8220;Folsom Prison Blues&#8221; by Johnny Cash, and did a piss poor job. Later in the night, we played &#8220;suicide&#8221;, where you would sign someone else up for a song, and not tell them what song they had. T-Dawg put me down for &#8220;Lay Lady Lady&#8221; by Bob Dylan, which I didn&#8217;t know, but muddled through with his help. I signed up this guy for &#8220;She&#8217;s A Lady&#8221;, which he at first said he didn&#8217;t know, but once it started, he rocked the box.

Erika didn&#8217;t do any karaoke because she&#8217;s a punk. Actually it was funny; one guy kept trying to talk her into doing it, and was like &#8220;Don&#8217;t be scared of singing&#8230;don&#8217;t you sing in the shower? Can you sing at all?&#8221;

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Curiously, I&#8217;m wondering if he knew what she did professionally. She wasn&#8217;t the only opera star there.</span>

Stayed out way too late, but had fun.
