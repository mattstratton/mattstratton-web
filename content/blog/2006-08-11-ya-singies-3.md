Last night was the second night in a row that I went to Congress and Michigan to hear a concert. However, last night&#8217;s performance was substantially different than Wednesday &#8211; there&#8217;s a night and day gap between Waits and opera :)

Carrie got to hear sing for the first time last night as we joined [Kevin][1], , , , and Michael and Adrianne to hear Erika&#8217;s &#8220;preview&#8221; recital of the stuff she&#8217;ll be rocking Germany with later this month. 

As always, I was blown away. It&#8217;s such a fun dichotomy, to me, to have such a powerful voice come out of little fun and quirky Erika. I&#8217;m certainly no expert, but I thought that her program covered a pretty wide range. Which I&#8217;m guessing was the point. I also thought it was hilarious (and quite a compliment to her performance) that the audience laughed at the appropriately comedic times, even though the words were in German. 

Or maybe we all just thought it was hilariously creepy that she was singing about wanting a 14 year old boy.
