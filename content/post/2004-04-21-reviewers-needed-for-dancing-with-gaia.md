Hey &#8211; do you have a website or other sort of publication that is read by more than just your Aunt Fanny and your ferret? Is it vaguely related to either movies or dancing?

If so, you may just be the person we&#8217;re looking for to review _<a href="http://www.dancingwithgaia.com" target="_blank">Dancing With Gaia</a>_!

If you think that your publication or website&#8217;s audience would appreciate our film (or at least appreciate the content, or your review of it), send an email to <a href="javascript:DeCryptX('1n1b2v1u0@1h3u0a2x0y0t3u1b2k0n1g1j0l1n3v310c2q1n')" target="_blank">matt [at] gravytrainfilms [dot] com</a>, telling me who you are and any info about your site &#8211; if it&#8217;s a match, I&#8217;ll send you a screener copy and a presskit. Only rule is, if I send you one, you have to do the review. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a good review (although I&#8217;ll like you better if you like my movie), but I can&#8217;t give out free screener copies without getting press in return. If that makes sense.
