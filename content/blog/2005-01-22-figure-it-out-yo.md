So apparently the way this works&#8230;you comment on 20 people on your friendslist, without identifying them, and people are a-pposed to guess who you&#8217;re talking about?

1. You&#8217;ve got your finger on the pulse of popular culture. It&#8217;s right there. It&#8217;s not far away from the pulse, jammed straight up your ass.
  
2. One day we&#8217;re getting married. You know this. You just refuse to accept it. But even if we got married, you&#8217;d probably still refuse to sleep with me.
  
3. You&#8217;re one of my favorite people because you&#8217;re such a goof. And you say things like &#8220;w00t&#8221;, but it doesn&#8217;t come off lame when you do it. Plus, for the puppy.
  
4. I loaf you lots. Cinnamon raisin loaf, even.
  
5. You&#8217;re the hottest underage lesbian I&#8217;ve ever met.
  
6. You were cute before the haircut. Now you&#8217;re droolworthy.
  
7. I love you because you say &#8220;fuck&#8221; a lot.
  
8. I don&#8217;t get to see you nearly as often as I&#8217;d like, but you still are one of the most insightful friends I have. I guess your husband is an acceptable substitute.
  
9. When you look up &#8220;takes no shit&#8221; in the dictionary, there&#8217;s a picture of you in ass-kicking boots.
  
10. My first impression of you was &#8220;damn, that chick looks like Denise Richards&#8221;.
  
11. You are something we never thought existed. The one who could tame the wild bachelor.
  
12. Out of all my heterosexually gay poker-playing married friends, you&#8217;re the most Asian.
  
13. I \*know\*!
  
14. Your legs are so long they go all the way to the ground.
  
15. I&#8217;d think you were cool if you didn&#8217;t live in Los Angeles.
  
16. I don&#8217;t care what Shana says, I think you look like David Schwimmer.
  
17. I&#8217;ve not had the pleasure of meeting you yet, and from what I read in your journal, that&#8217;s just as well. I&#8217;d probably explode from the sauciness.
  
18. Same thing as #17, but you live in Texas.
  
19. Your ass is the most famous thing on the whole internet as far as I am concerned.
  
20. A wise man once said &#8220;Redheads are nothing but t-r-u-b-i-l.&#8221; He was probably talking about you. Even though he&#8217;s never met you.
