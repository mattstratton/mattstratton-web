This week&#8217;s Fussy Follow Friday recommendation is the always amusing and exuberant <a href="http://twitter.com/jenniferalaine" target="_blank"><strong>@jenniferalaine</strong></a>. In addition to being a prolific and hilarious <a href="http://youllgrowtoloveme.com/" target="_blank">blogger</a>, Jenn will add value to your Twitter experience by constantly reminding you that Twitter can be FUN.

Yes, I said fun. Forget about &#8220;brand building&#8221; and &#8220;joining the conversation&#8221; with all your social media strategies. Sometimes it&#8217;s okay to just flat-out enjoy yourself. And tweets from Jenn will definitely make that happen. Besides a proliferation of &#8220;that&#8217;s what she said&#8221; references, Jenn&#8217;s tweets range from snarky observations about social interactions to a professed love of pancakes (especially from Egg Harbor Cafe). She is interactive and definitely doesn&#8217;t see Twitter as a &#8220;one way&#8221; communication. Which, for me, is pretty awesome.

So unless you only use Twitter to &#8220;enhance your brand&#8217;s social media presence&#8221;, you should follow <a href="http://twitter.com/jenniferalaine" target="_blank">@jenniferalaine</a> immediately. I promise you will come away feeling satisfied with a big smile on your face (twss).

_Fussy Follow Friday is based upon the concept that instead of a glut of Twitter follow recommendations, I will make one, and ONLY ONE, follow recommendation per Friday. For more information, the Library of Congress recommends <a href="/follow-friday/fussy-follow-friday/" target="_self">this blog post</a>._
