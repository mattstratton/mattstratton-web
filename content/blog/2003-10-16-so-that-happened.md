It hasn&#8217;t really sunk in yet. So I&#8217;m going to not post anything about this for a few days at least.

But I did just come home to an email from my mom. I am going to post that email, and my response.

Subject:[/b] til next year

Just remember that they gave you a thrilling summer. And, unless, the management follows the usual Chicago tradition of trading away good players, they will be back.

Love,
  
Mom

_My response:_

It was really weird tonight.

I was on the edge of my seat all night&#8230;after Bako flied out for three, I just stood there for a while, looking out over the field. And the thing is&#8230;I wasn&#8217;t that sad. I think it took a while for it to really hit me that it was over. But the thing that I was doing, was just looking out at Wrigley Field and realizing that it would be five more months until I&#8217;d be there again.

Frankly, they came further than I thought they would this year. And I was thinking the same thing you mentioned &#8211; I&#8217;ve been thinking about all the exciting baseball I&#8217;ve seen at the Friendly Confines this year (tonight was my 13th game). I feel sorrier for the bandwagon fans&#8230;the rest of us are used to this. Yes, we&#8217;re disappointed, but we&#8217;ve been here before. And when we say &#8220;wait until next year&#8221;, we mean it.

I can&#8217;t wait until Opening Day. And I hope the Marlins win it all, preferably beating the Yankees. Because they have really impressed me in this series as being a class act; Pudge calming down Sammy after that brushback pitch in Game 5, for example. And tonight, when Joe Bo was warming up, I saw the third base coach for the Marlins chatting with Aramis Ramirez&#8230;joking around. That just floors me. That&#8217;s sportsmanship. And it&#8217;s what baseball should be all about.

I&#8217;m sad that I won&#8217;t be sitting at Wrigley for a World Series this year. But I&#8217;ve gotten to witness some amazing things. And I&#8217;ll remember this season for a long time, if not forever.

It was a great season. And as always, I&#8217;m proud to be a Cubs fan. And I&#8217;m sure Grandpa Leonard is with Harry right now saying &#8220;wait until next year&#8221; just like the rest of us.
