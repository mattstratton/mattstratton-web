So Carrie made me dinner tonight.

For those of you playing at home, Carrie is the girl I met at Louis&#8217;s birthday party about a month ago. She&#8217;s the girl who calls me every day, and we&#8217;ve gone out a bunch of times, but I have been being kind of dumb about.

Anyway, tonight was a really spectacular date. She made vegetarian lasagna (so as to avoid the pork issue) and Rice Krispy Treats for dessert (she&#8217;s a 2nd grade teacher; it&#8217;s pretty funny). We watched some goofy TV (since going out with Carrie, I&#8217;ve seen more &#8220;Road Rules&#8221; and reality TV than I have in my entire life). I met her other roommate, and bullshit with the roommate I&#8217;d already met.

Other things developed, which are nice. She&#8217;s coming to the Micetro on Saturday, as well as Saturday night&#8217;s dance at Wrigley. Amusingly enough, she suggested that we set Backstreet up with her roommate, which I&#8217;d already considered. I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;d be interested, but I told her to bring her roommate to the Beeyachski band&#8217;s gig next week. Who knows what might happen.

I feel good about this, I think.
