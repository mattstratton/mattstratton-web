So, last night, I had a date with this girl Melissa.

We went out on a few dates a couple of years ago&#8230;the record of our first date can be found [here][1].

Anyway&#8230;last night we were supposed to go out to dinner and then go to Green Dolphin Street for cocktail and jazz.

I couldn&#8217;t think of a good place to go for dinner, so I decided to make dinner myself. Shana helped me out with a great recipe.

Melissa really liked the food. She commented on it several times. And she liked the wine. After dinner, she was really tired (she did a ride-along with some paramedics during the day; she&#8217;s a nurse), so she decided to head for home. It was a nice evening, and I&#8217;m not really upset that nothing else happened. Although I am a little upset about drinking that really nice cab with her&#8230;it was so good, I almost wish I had saved it for a better occasion. But then again, like Tracy says&#8230;wine is for drinking.

I&#8217;m working from home today, which means I&#8217;m doing nothing. Oh, and Happy Festivus, you bastards.
