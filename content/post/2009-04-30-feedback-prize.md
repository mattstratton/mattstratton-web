That&#8217;s it! Comments will be open until the evening of May 7, 2009. At that point, I will take all the commenters, and assign each of them a number. I will pull a random number using <a href="http://www.random.org/integers/" target="_blank">Random.org</a>, and that person will be the recipient of a $25 Amazon.com gift certificate, which will be emailed to the email address used to leave the comment. Don&#8217;t worry &#8211; I will not do anything nefarious with your email addresses. This contest is open to everyone except for members of my immediate family. Thanks!
