My Twitter follow recommendation for this week is one of my all-time favorites&#8230;<a href="http://twitter.com/kellyg5" target="_blank"><strong>@KellyG5</strong></a>.

If you like your Twitter full of inspiration and hilarity, then you need to <a href="http://twitter.com/kellyg5" target="_blank">follow @KellyG5 </a>_immediately_. Seriously. Do it RIGHT NOW. You can come back and read the rest of this post later. I&#8217;ll wait for you. I promise.

Did you follow her yet? Good! Now, here&#8217;s what you can expect from <a href="http://twitter.com/kellyg5" target="_blank">@KellyG5</a> being featured in your twitterstream:

  1. Possible issues with your co-workers being annoyed by you literally laughing aloud at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/kellyg5" target="_blank">her YouTube videos</a>
  2. 100% of your daily RCC (Recommended Canadian Content)
  3. Amazing engagement and a permanent smile on your face every time you read one of her tweets
  4. Future fame and fortune (okay, just fame) by possibly being included in one of her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPBPXGs1g1g" target="_blank">LIFT videos</a>.
  5. The hair. Oh god, the hair.

Those five reasons should be more than enough for you to take the time to add <a href="http://twitter.com/kellyg5" target="_blank">@KellyG5</a> to your follow list on Twitter. But if that&#8217;s not enough, how about this? She&#8217;s one of the nicest and most genuine people I follow &#8211; and she somehow manages to do that without having to cut back on the snark. That&#8217;s skillz, people. Mad Twitter skillz. Recognize.

_Fussy Follow Friday is based upon the concept that instead of a glut of Twitter follow recommendations, I will make one, and ONLY ONE, follow recommendation per Friday. For more information, the Library of Congress recommends <a href="../2009/07/17/2009/07/10/2009/06/10/fussy-follow-friday/" target="_self">this blog post</a>._
