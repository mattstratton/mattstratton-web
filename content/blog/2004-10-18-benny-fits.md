All my various insurances kick in on Nov 1.

So I&#8217;m putting off a bunch of stuff. Quitting smoking? That&#8217;ll be Nov 1 when my prescription benefit kicks in and I can get the good drugs to help with that.

I need new contacts, but I&#8217;m going to wait until Nov 1 because then I can get them cheap/free. Oh crap. I can&#8217;t do that &#8211; Lippy&#8217;s party is before then, and I won&#8217;t be seen in public without my contacts. Blech.

I have a small cavity in one of my teeth, and that waits until Nov 1 once my dental insurance kicks in.

One thing that is cool &#8211; JPMC covers &#8220;domestic partners&#8221; on all insurances. So if I was gay or had a live-in girlfriend, they&#8217;d be covered. Neither of these are a major concern right now, but I think it&#8217;s cool that they do that.
