So I&#8217;ve been using [So I&#8217;ve been using][1] as my exclusive email account for a week or so now.

Here are my thoughts:

1) It misbehaves a little in [Firefox][2]. Every now and again, I get a message I just can&#8217;t open in FF, but if I load up IE, I can view the conversation. This seems to happen mostly on conversations with a bunch of messages, but not always. Truthfully, I haven&#8217;t figured out the rhyme or reason to it.

2) I keep forgetting that Gmail displays ads based upon the content of the message you are reading &#8211; and by that, I mean I just don&#8217;t notice them. I keep trying to remind myself to look for them, just because I&#8217;m curious as to what ads target my email messages. But I don&#8217;t notice them at all. This means a) they are non-intrusive, and b) they don&#8217;t work very well at all.

3) Contact management still isn&#8217;t super great. But it&#8217;s accomplished what I want &#8211; people I need to email are in my address book, and actually, the only time I open the contacts list is when I am sending a message to lots of people. Normally the auto-complete feature works well.

4) [Keyboard shortcuts][3] are teh awesome and I need to remember to use them more often.
