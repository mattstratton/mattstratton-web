I am so antsy waiting for tomorrow night&#8217;s game.

It will be the first postseason game at Wrigley that I&#8217;ll be watching on the TV.

It is funny how EVERY SINGLE PERSON in Chicago is suddenly a Cubs fan&#8230;hearing some of my friends sing the praises of Mark Prior and lament the disappointment that is Alfonseca&#8230;it amuses me. These are people who, a scant four weeks ago, probably didn&#8217;t even know who Kerry Wood was, or that Mark Grudzielanek wasn&#8217;t their alderman.
