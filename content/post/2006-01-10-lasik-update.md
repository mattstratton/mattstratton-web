So I had my consult today.

It was pretty cool (although I&#8217;ve done it before, about five years ago). It took about an hour &#8211; they gave me a basic eye exam, took pictures of my eyes, dilated my pupils, and measured the thickness of my cornea (this was weird; they put drops in my eyes to numb them, and then actually TOUCHED my eyeball with a measuring tool. Weird.)

I&#8217;m an excellent candidate for LASIK (I knew this). I have small pupils and a thick cornea.

Here&#8217;s the problem.

When I called TruVision last year during open enrollment (to figure out how much money to put into my FSA, etc), they told me that regular LASIK was $895/eye, but &#8220;custom&#8221; LASIK was $1,295/eye. I did some research on the &#8220;custom&#8221; LASIK, and figured that I was happy with the &#8220;regular&#8221; flavor. So I elected to put $1,800 in my FSA.

Well, today, I was told that this doctor (who is the only one in the Chicago area that does the TruVision plan, which is what I need for the big discount) &#8220;only&#8221; does custom LASIK. I have to talk to the admin assistant tomorrow in order to discuss appointments, etc, but I kind of feel like I don&#8217;t need the &#8220;custom&#8221; one. And I think that they actually \*will\* do the &#8220;regular&#8221; kind, but they don&#8217;t like to (long story short &#8211; with &#8220;regular&#8221; LASIK they correct you based only upon your prescription, with &#8220;custom&#8221; they map the inside of your eye and correct based upon your exact eye shape, etc).

I would hate to have the surgery be less successful because I wanted to cheap out on $800. But again&#8230;everyone I know who has had LASIK has had excellent results, and they all had the boring, &#8220;normal&#8221; LASIK. And I know that my eyes are pretty normal.

We&#8217;ll see what they say tomorrow.
