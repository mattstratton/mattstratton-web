Do people really make that many collect calls that it&#8217;s necessary to force Carrot Top on the TV viewing public?

I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever received a collect call.

Last time I \*made\* a collect call was probably when I was in high school.

Seriously. Are there that many collect-call-makers?
