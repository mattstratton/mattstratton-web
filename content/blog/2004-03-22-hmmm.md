Ok, so as you may recall, two weeks ago I went to the Hugo awards with my friend Brian.

When there, I met a chick who works for _Screen_ magazine. She&#8217;s pretty cute and really friendly. I decided I must try to ask her out as some point. Of course, I was pretty drunk when I decided that.

Anyway, I had promised to hook her up with some software &#8220;for evaluation purposes only&#8221; for her PC. She emailed me last week to follow up, and I replied telling her I&#8217;d burned copies of the two programs she needed. This is her reply:

 _OK &#8212; I now owe you my first born child!!! You rock!_

_Let me know the best time/way to get it from you!_

_By the way, are you receiving the magazine? If not, I&#8217;ll give you a 6 mo. comp. Let me know!_

_S\***\***

Question is&#8230;how to proceed?
