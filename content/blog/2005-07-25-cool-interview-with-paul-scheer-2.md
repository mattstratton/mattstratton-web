sent me a link to a really interesting **[interview][1]** with **Paul Scheer** of **[Best Week Ever][2]** fame.

I recommend checking it out. I was fascinated. Especially you BWE fans &#8211; there&#8217;s some interesting stuff about their process:

_Basically the night before they give you this eight to fifteen page outline. Here are a list of topics and questions. Such as Britney Spears is having a baby and there are ten questions on that. Do you think Britney Spears will be a good mom? What mothering advice would you give Britney Spears? You go in and you know what you are going to talk about. I get it that night, write down stuff, and riff when I’m in there. The questions are pre-written and I think a lot of us write our responses beforehand because you have takes on it. You are basically creating a standup comedy set for that next bit. Here are the specifics now go in and make jokes of these ideas. The writers of _Best Week Ever_ are there to craft the piece, to have an angle. So it’s not us randomly talking about things, they have a point of view._
