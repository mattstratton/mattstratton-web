Had a boffo night at the Fizzle on Monday night. Drank way too much, had a great birthday jam (seriously, I danced like I sorta kinda one day might get the hang of this so-called &#8220;Lindy Hop&#8221;), had fun talking to folks, and ended up at Kingston Mines and later the Diner Grill.

Got home at 5 am, and woke up at 8 to do some work on a network for this photog associate of Lippy. Finished that, took a nap, and then went to a fantastic Columbian steakhouse for a birthday dinner treat.
