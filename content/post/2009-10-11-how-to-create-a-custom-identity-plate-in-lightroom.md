Last week, I <a href="http://twitpic.com/kw56j" target="_blank">posted a picture showing off my new dual-screen setup on my home PC</a>. My good pal <a href="http://twitter.com/mteson" target="_blank">Marcelo</a> was not impressed with my double-monitor goodness, but he WAS curious as to how I set up a custom &#8220;logo&#8221; on my Lightroom screen. It&#8217;s super easy &#8211; and here&#8217;s how.

First step, when you fire up Lightroom, go to the Edit menu and select Identity Plate Setup (it&#8217;s the last option in the menu. That will take you to this screen:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/iplate.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5580" title="iplate" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/iplate.png" alt="iplate" width="567" height="245" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/iplate.png 945w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/10/iplate-300x129.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" /></a>
</p>

This is the &#8220;control panel&#8221; by which you can totally customize how Lightroom looks, with your own branding. All that I did was pick &#8220;Use a styled text identity plate&#8221;, and type in the name that I wanted &#8211; and then style the text using standard font editing options. If you want, you could create a complete graphic for your identity plate, and then drag it in (once you picked &#8220;Use a graphical identity plate&#8221;).

It&#8217;s THAT simple. Seriously. So what&#8217;s keeping you from doing it? Why give Adobe all the press in your Lightroom installation?
