Had a really long talk yesterday with a friend of mine&#8230;about the whole concept of wanting the people you can&#8217;t have and stuff.

There are two women that I am interested in right now. Neither of which are within possibility. One due to geographical concerns (among others, but we&#8217;ll blame geography), and the other I am pretty sure is not interested in me. Sure we might get drunk one night, but I don&#8217;t want to do that. Because I do like that girl.

So instead I spend my time with women where it&#8217;s more like &#8220;well hey, there&#8217;s nothing good on tv&#8221;.

The one thing that makes me not feel too horrible about it is that nothing really happens anyway.
