**Rules**
  
_1. Put your playlist on shuffle.
  
2. Post the first lines to the first 20 non-instrumental songs to come up (along with these instructions). Delete anything with the title in the first line.
  
3. Have people guess the songs and artists in comments to the post.
  
4. Post the answers to the ones people guessed correctly. A couple of days later, post the first two lines of the ones no one got and get people to guess again.
  
5. Repeat, adding the next line to the unguessed songs each time, until they&#8217;re all guessed/you&#8217;ve posted the whole song/you&#8217;ve gotten bored/no-one&#8217;s going to get the damn thing if you don&#8217;t tell them.</p> 

</em>**Don&#8217;t use search engines when guessing!
