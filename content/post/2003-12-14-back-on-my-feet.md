So I&#8217;m pretty much recovered from the Sonic Death Flu&#8230;I still am not 100%, but I am feeling much better.

Tonight was a blast. Mertz hired Tom and I to be &#8220;bouncers&#8221; at this Roaring 20&#8217;s theme party&#8230;basically, we dressed up like gangsters and hassled the guests on their way into the party.

It was fun. I&#8217;ll post a picture later. Most of the guests at the party were pretty dull and lame and didn&#8217;t play along (it was a computer consulting company&#8217;s holiday party) and I think some of them were stressed out due to the bad weather; this one guy was really jerky &#8211; Tom was doing his bit where he would &#8220;frisk&#8221; at a guy, and this guy said &#8220;Are you kidding me? I&#8217;ve been in traffic for two hours. I just want a drink.&#8221; I feel bad for people who don&#8217;t know how to have fun.

We had a good time though. The woman who was running the party loved us. She wanted our card, and this other woman who works for the place the party was at wanted to know if we did other parties and other characters. They thought we were from Second City. Of course, I considered that an insult :) But that&#8217;s the improv snob in me.
