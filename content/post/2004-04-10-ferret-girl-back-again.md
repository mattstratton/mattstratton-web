So I went on a date tonight (I guess it was a date) with [Ferret Girl][1].

Interestingly enough, I looked at that old entry, which basically confirmed that our first date was almost exactly one year ago. Freaky.

Anyway, we went out to dinner with her friend from work and said friend&#8217;s boyfriend. Had quite a few cocktails, and a good time. Evening ended with me loaning her some DVD&#8217;s and an extended fooling around session.

She said something about definitely seeing me again in the very near future. Which I&#8217;ve heard before. I don&#8217;t know. I really like this girl, but I can&#8217;t let myself like her. For a couple reasons. One, she&#8217;s got a bad track record with falling off the face of the earth with me. Two, she&#8217;s going to move to England eventually (probably in about a year).

But she&#8217;s really cute. And I always have fun with her.

We shall see.
