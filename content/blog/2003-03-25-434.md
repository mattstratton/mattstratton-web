Perhaps you will say that it should be covered under free speech. And I do agree that if we believe in free speech, we must protect the very statements that we disagree with.

But this, to me, isn&#8217;t a &#8220;free speech&#8221; issue. &#8220;Free speech&#8221; doesn&#8217;t protect you against shouting &#8220;fire&#8221; in a crowded theater, and it also won&#8217;t protect you if you started yelling on a soapbox trying to get people rallied together to go shoot the mayor.

Secondly, people like this compromise what peace demonstrators might accomplish. Like PETA, extremists may make for good news, but it makes it much easier for Joe Sixpack to dismiss your cause when he sees it on the 6 PM news.

Just more evidence that not everything is black and white.
