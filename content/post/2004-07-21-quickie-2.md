Just a quick update.

Going to see <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387412/" target="_blank"><em>Some Kind of Monster</em></a> tonight. Should be fun.

Work is going well. I&#8217;m super busy there. Eep!

Online girl has been kicked to the curb. I think I already posted that.

is cool. No particular reason. I just felt like saying that.

Going camping in September. is going too. I hope we don&#8217;t get lost and have to eat someone.

I&#8217;ve had a houseguest for the last week and a half. I think she&#8217;s leaving soon. I hope so. She&#8217;s a nice person, but I want my house back.
