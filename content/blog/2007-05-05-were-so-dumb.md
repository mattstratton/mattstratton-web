Today started off as a very good day. Carrie and I slept in a little bit, got up, and went to Cafe Sel Marie for brunch. Yum.

Afterwards, we did a little shopping for supplies for some wedding craftiness. This is when the day went to craptown.

We were in Target picking out some placecards for the rehearsal dinner. Carrie says to me &#8220;Um, are you sure Bark in the Park is tomorrow?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, I am sure,&#8221; I said.

&#8220;Are you _positive_?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Because I just saw two people walk by with Bark in the Park t-shirts on.&#8221;

&#8220;Maybe they are last year&#8217;s shirts,&#8221; I suggested.

&#8220;Well then,&#8221; Carrie pointed out, &#8220;Why do they have their numbers pinned to them?&#8221;

I whipped out the BlackBerry, and pulled up www.barkinthepark.org.

Sure enough, the date read as &#8220;Saturday, May 5&#8221;.

Crap.

So yeah. We totally missed it. So we just made a very sizable donation to the Anti-Cruelty Society.

And we don&#8217;t even get our t-shirts.
