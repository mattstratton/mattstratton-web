My receiver just died.

My roommate came into the room and said &#8220;there&#8217;s something wrong with the sound thing.&#8221;

Basically, when you power on the receiver, it clicks over and over again, and the standby light keeps blinking.

I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in. No dice.

Tried a different outlet. No joy.

Of course, then my roommate says something like &#8220;Oh yeah, and the lights dimmed earlier.&#8221;

Argh.

I&#8217;ve got the thing plugged into a heavy-duty surge protector/line conditioner, but apparently that&#8217;s not enough.

It&#8217;s almost three years old; definitely out of warranty. Argh. Don&#8217;t my toys know I have no money right now?!
