Working from home today. It&#8217;s so cold out!

Got some new DVD&#8217;s in the past few days:

_Secretary_ &#8211; I haven&#8217;t seen this yet (I know, I know, I suck) and since I picked it up for only nine bucks, it was not much more than renting it. Still haven&#8217;t watched it yet though.

_A Mighty Wind_&#8211; I&#8217;m a mock-doc fanboy, so I had to get it. And this thing is LOADED with commentary&#8230;which I loved on both _Guffman_ and _Best in Show_].

_Josie and the Pussycats_ &#8211; a great comedy. Much MUCH better than I&#8217;d thought it would be when I first heard of it&#8230;the commentary is pretty funny too. Plus it&#8217;s got Parker. And Rachel Leigh Cook is so damn cute in this movie.

_Tenacious D &#8211; The Complete Master Works_ &#8211; this DVD is worth the price of admission for the music video of &#8220;Tribute&#8221; alone. I remember watching this show when it was on HBO at like 2 AM. First time I saw Jack Black in a movie, I was like &#8220;Hey! It&#8217;s that guy from Tenacious D!&#8221;

_The Ben Stiller Show_ &#8211; Such a fun sketch show. I remember it being a lot funnier. The commentary is great though. And &#8220;Melrose Heights 90210-4206&#8221; will always be one of my favorite sketches.

What else&#8230;Carrie keeps threatening to clean my apartment. I&#8217;m amused and embarrassed.
