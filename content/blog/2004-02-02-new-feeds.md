I&#8217;ve just created two new syndicated feeds:

&#8211; feed from [FuzzyCo][1], the improv blog of Fuzzy Gerdes.

&#8211; feed from Hey Fake Peterman, a sweet blog &#8220;dedicated to the J. Peterman character on Seinfeld, it discusses all things fake Peterman related, as well as other Seinfeld and Real Peterman stuff.&#8221;
