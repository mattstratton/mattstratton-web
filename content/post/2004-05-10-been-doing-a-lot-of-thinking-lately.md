One of the side effects of being unemployed is you have a lot of free time.

Couple that with several hours of road tripping, and the introspection just never ends.

I&#8217;ve found myself lately doing a lot of second-guessing. Trying to figure out why I let things &#8220;get away&#8221;. I don&#8217;t want to live my life in regret, so that&#8217;s not what this is about.

But sometimes I think about things I let slip away due to &#8220;greener grass&#8221; syndrome, and for the life of me, I can&#8217;t understand why I did.
