I am so stealing this idea from .

Basically, here&#8217;s how it works (I&#8217;m possibly modifying it a little from Autumn&#8217;s original post):

If you&#8217;re interested, you mail me a mix CD of your own choosing. What kind of mix? Totally up to you &#8211; it can be a mix of stuff you think I&#8217;ll like. Or a mix of stuff you like but everyone hates. Or maybe it&#8217;s just 20 versions of &#8220;The Little Drummer Boy&#8221;.

Mail the CD (preferably with a track listing) to

Matt Stratton

1021 W. Wellington Ave

Apt 2

Chicago, IL 60657

&#8230;and include a return address for me to send YOU a mix CD in exchange.

Fun, no?
