So our friend who works for the Cubs snagged us some tickets to this Saturday&#8217;s game vs. the Yankees&#8230;apparently it&#8217;s gonna be a good one. I see that tickets for that game are going for an average for $300, and some seats are going for over a grand&#8230;

&#8230;and ours were thirty-five bucks. Should be good though&#8230;Clemens vs. Wood.
