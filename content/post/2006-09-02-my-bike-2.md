Not that you all were clamoring to see what my bike looks like, but here it is anyway.

I just installed the rear rack, panniers, and the front fender today. And some lights. I had trouble with the rear fender, and just gave up for now. I&#8217;ll install it later. The rear rack should offer SOME protection.

The cool thing is that Carrie discovered that there are bajillions of miles of bike paths in the Chicago area forest preserves &#8211; we&#8217;re not limited to the lakefront path and it&#8217;s annoying rollerbladers! I think tomorrow we&#8217;re going to try the North Shore Channel Trail &#8211; from what I can see, we pick it up at Lawrence, and it goes up to Evanston. I was reading that there are some dicey crossings, but it should be a fun one to try.
