One of the biggest differences between the suburbs and the city&#8230;.in the burbs, organizations (such as churches or neighborhood associations) assume all members have been there for 20+ years and &#8220;know how things are done&#8221;. In the city, details are spelled out.

For example: suburban church says &#8220;nursery will be open in September&#8221;, meaning &#8220;after Labor Day&#8221;, but not specifying. Because, you know, it ALWAYS opens after Labor Day. Don&#8217;t you _know_ that?

City church? &#8220;Nursery will open on Sept 11.&#8221; Clear. Informative. Anyone can see this detail and make plans.

I think that this is due, mostly, to the fact that that in the city, there are more transient folks. People who HAVEN&#8217;T been there for years and years, so they GET that.

We had another issue like this with our neighborhood association. Every year for Labor Day weekend, there is a big pig roast in the park. The neighborhood associate sends out the flyers with registration information, sign-up to help do things like give out drinks, etc.

Well, last year, we showed up (second year we&#8217;d gone) and there are a ton of tables set up by the event. We pulled up to one of the tables and put the boys and their stuff there.

Shortly afterwards, a woman came up and said that they&#8217;d &#8220;reserved&#8221; that table. Apparently, if you get to the event in the morning and put a TABLECLOTH on an event table, you have called &#8220;dibs&#8221; on it for the entire day.

This, mostly, is why we did not attend the event today. We kind of hate our neighborhood now.
