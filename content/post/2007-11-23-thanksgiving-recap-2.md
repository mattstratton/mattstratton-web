As you know, Carrie and I had a &#8220;test run&#8221; of our Thanksgiving last weekend. Well, yesterday was the &#8220;real deal&#8221;. And it turned out pretty well.

As you can see, it&#8217;s quite chilly for Thanksgiving morning. Snow on the grill doesn&#8217;t bode well for outdoor Thanksgiving cooking.

This is the prepped turkey. It spent the night before soaked in brine, and then Carrie stuffed it with aromatics, and did a butter/olive oil rub under the skin.

The turkey on the grill. Cooked using the indirect method, with apple wood chips added for smoky goodness.

About two and a half hours later, the final result. Nice and crispy skin.

Here&#8217;s the carved bird, using the [&#8220;butcher method&#8221;][6]. We barely had any leftovers.
