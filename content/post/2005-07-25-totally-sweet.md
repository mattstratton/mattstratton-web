If I felt more physically comfortable, I would totally take this workshop. I still might.

<a href="http://www.actorsgymnasium.com/site/epage/11348_314.htm" target="_blank"><strong>500 Clown: Risk, Play, and Relationship</strong></a>

The trio known as 500 Clown creates some of the most accomplished foolishness
  
and significant slapstick in Chicago theater. Now the Actors Gymnasium is pleased
  
to present a 500 Clown workshop, exploring the use of physical risk to access
  
emotional risk onstage. The class will help participants develop a sense of play in
  
performance and probe the multiple relationships that keep a performer reactive and
  
body-centered rather than stuck in his or her head. Come dressed to move.
  
**Taught by the members of 500 Clown: Molly Brennan, Adrian Danzig, and
  
Paul Kalina.**
