Hi folks! I&#8217;m coming to you live from the MIX09 conference in sunny Las Vegas, Nevada. I will be composing a much more robust post later summarizing what I&#8217;ve learned here, but for now, I wanted to simply share with you some of the cool things that came up in this morning&#8217;s Keynote address.

This morning, as part of the MIX keynote, Microsoft released the latest version of their browser, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx" target="_blank">Internet Explorer 8</a>. There are a bunch of nice features that have been added to the browser, although I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s enough to make someone switch from a different browser if they&#8217;re not already an IE user. However, if you use IE as your primary web browser, I highly recommend installing this latest version, as the new features are pretty compelling.

One thing that I really like is that each tab in IE 8 runs in an isolated process. This is a fancy way of saying that if a page in a tab crashes, it won&#8217;t take the other tabs down with it. Chrome already does this, and it&#8217;s VERY nice.

IE 8 has also added a feature called InPrivate browsing (Safari already has this). This is a good thing if you are browsing a bunch of inappropriate sites and you want to &#8220;cover your tracks&#8221;.

There are some other nice tweaks, including Web Slices (a way to &#8220;subscribe&#8221; to certain websites), Accelerators (to move information from one site to another, such as an address to a map site, etc), and improved search capabilities.

Finally &#8211; here is a link to a hilarious video they used to introduce IE 8 at the keynote. It&#8217;s quite entertaining and not just because it includes a unicorn (seriously).
