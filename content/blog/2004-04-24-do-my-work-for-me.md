I know some of you have seen _Dancing With Gaia_, and I&#8217;m having a hard time coming up with the two sentence summary for the press kit.

This is what I&#8217;ve got now, which I don&#8217;t especially care for:

_DANCING WITH GAIA is a DV movie about the quest to find oneself through swing dancing and hippie craziness. The story follows Zoe through her journey while trying to do things with potato salad.
  
_ 

Any ideas on how better to sum up the film in two sentences? Your assistance is appreciated!
