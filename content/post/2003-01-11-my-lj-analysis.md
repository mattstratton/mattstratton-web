<span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="http://dandycat.livejournal.com/"><strong>dandycat</strong></a></span> had this in her LJ&#8230;so I figured I&#8217;d post my Livejournal Analasys.

# Your Livejournal Analasys

### Your Livejournal&#8217;s Age

According to the information you provided, your Livejournal was created on 2001-04-01, meaning that your journal has been around for 649 days. What does this mean?

With over a year of LJ experience under your belt, you can safely call yourself an experienced user. If you are still actively using your journal by now, then chances are you are here to stay. You probably don&#8217;t add friends nearly as often as you used to, and more than likely have removed a bunch of people that used to be there. Staying in an online community for a year is something of an achievement, you know.

### Your Livejournal Friends

Now let&#8217;s talk about your friends list. You indicated that you have 83 LJ friends.
  
You have something of a large friends list, and let&#8217;s be honest, you probably don&#8217;t really read them all, do you? Okay, so your journal has been around, it&#8217;s to be expected that you have a fairly large friends list. Some of these people might have been names you added at some point in the past, but you can&#8217;t really remember why. A good portion of these journals are probably from people you only know in passing, and you don&#8217;t really consider them friends as much as friendly folks.

You also have been listed as a friend by 58 users.
  
You have quite a few people watching your list, and have become pretty popular. You are well established in the time you&#8217;ve had your journal, and now it looks like you&#8217;ve established yourself pretty well. Probably got around in a few of them Livejournal groups, probably have a lot of addbacks from your own friends list. How many of these people really know you, however?

Finally in this category, you have a friends to friends-of ratio of 1.4310344827586.
  
This is a relatively high ratio, meaning you add quite a few more people than have added you to their friends list. This may be a sign that you tend to add people fairly randomly to your list, although there is also a good chance that you simply do not advertise your own journal much, and don&#8217;t expect too many people to be adding you back.

### Your Posting Habits

You have indicated that to date, you have made 352 entries into your Livejournal. This gives us an average post rate of 0.54237288135593 posts per day.
  
With this kind of post rate, you are updating at least once every other day, sometimes once a day. This seems to indicate that you like to keep your friends (or simply your journal) updated on the day to day progress of your life, no matter how boring or exciting. There are days when you simply have nothing to say, and on those days you simply say nothing, although you make a good effort to update when you can.

### Your Commenting Habits

According to your information, you have posted 750 comments and have recieved 713 of them over the lifetime of your journal. Let&#8217;s see what this information can mean.

First of all, this indicates that you have been getting an average of 2.0255681818182 comments for every Livejournal entry that you make.
  
With an average of at least 2 comments per post or greater, you enjoy a healthy dialogue with your friends and get a lot of response to what you have to say. You might also be posting those silly web quizzes, or making entries that are so interesting or so unusual that people can&#8217;t help but to comment. Either that, or you just have a buttload of friends.

A more fair measure of how many comments you get might be your average number of comments per post per friend, which is 0.02440443592552. This may seem low to you, especially if you have lots of friends.

The final statistic is the ratio of your comments to comments you get. Your ratio is 1.0518934081346. The higher the ratio, the more talkative you are compared to your friends, comment-wise.

That&#8217;s it for now! Perhaps there was something insightful in this analasys, and perhaps you learned absolutely nothing. Feel free to post your results on your own Livejournal, and invite your friends to take the Livejournal Analasys today!
