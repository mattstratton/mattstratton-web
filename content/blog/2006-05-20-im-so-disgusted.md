Seriously, baseball &#8220;fans&#8221; in my city disgust me.

Why the hell is it that you can&#8217;t just enjoy the success (or failure) of the team you support? Why do fans on both North and South sides have to be such giant douchebags about the whole thing? Sure, there are quite a few drunk-ass Trixies who enjoy their time at Wrigley Field. That doesn&#8217;t mean that &#8220;all Cubs fans just like to drink and don&#8217;t know baseball.&#8221; And yes, quite a few Sox fans are ignorant fucktards, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that is one.

Brawls during a game are nothing to be happy about. Michael Barrett isn&#8217;t a &#8220;hero&#8221; for punching AJ. This is the MLB &#8211; not the NBA.

But more of a disgrace are the so-called &#8220;fans&#8221; of both teams, teams with much greater history than their fans of today, who find it more important to focus on a so-called &#8220;rivalry&#8221; between two teams who don&#8217;t even play in the same league, much less the same division.

Respect the game, people. It&#8217;s older than you. Respect your city, people. It&#8217;s bigger than you.

Respect yourself too, while you&#8217;re at it.

This post was mostly inspired by jackass postings on some Cubs LJ communities, but it&#8217;s been brewing for several days now. And if this weekend is an indication, I think I might have some tickets for the Cubs/Sox contest at Wrigley next month that I just might want to sell, because I want no part of this bullshit that has nothing to do with baseball, and everything to do with douchebaggery
