Due to the snow and crappy roads, Carrie decided to stay in the burbs tonight instead of coming home.

It&#8217;s such a waste &#8211; I don&#8217;t have any BSG to catch up on, since I just finished the last disc of Season 2.5 the other day. I have a golden opportunity for NerdTV and I can&#8217;t take advantage of it.
