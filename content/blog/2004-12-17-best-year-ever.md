Be sure to tune into **Best Year Ever** TONIGHT at 11 ET (on VH1) to find out who had the Best Year Ever.

  * God?
  * Paris Hilton?
  * Some Dudes?
  * William Hung?
  * Britney Spears?

In the meantime, go to the [**Best Year Ever page**][1] and check out the video of William Hung singing &#8220;Deck The Halls.&#8221;
