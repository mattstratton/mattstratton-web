I was playing around a lot today, trying to understand my camera better. This is a picture I took of a littlz jazz statue in my living room. The only photoshopping here is basic color correction. I think it &#8220;pops&#8221;, and I like it a lot.

Bear in mind, I do not consider myself a &#8220;photographer&#8221;. I&#8217;m strictly a hobbyist here. My only goal is to one day take a picture that is 1/10th as good as the crappiest thing Lippy ever shot.
