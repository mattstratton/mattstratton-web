While poking around a bit today on the <a class="zem_slink" title="lijit" rel="homepage" href="http://www.lijit.com">Lijit</a> site, I came across a promo for a service/site called <a class="zem_slink" title="Zemanta" rel="homepage" href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a>. Described as a tool to &#8220;help you to blog smarter by suggesting related content, in real-time, for what you&#8217;re writing,&#8221; Zemanta seemed like something I wanted to check out.

Zemanta is a free service. It is enabled on your blog platform either by installing a plugin (if you&#8217;re self-hosted; plugins are available for WordPress, MoveableType, Joomla, and Drupal), or a browser extension. Fundamentally, it modifies the &#8220;New Post&#8221; screen in your blogging software to provide some additional components, as you can see in this screenshot:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/zemanta.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5783" title="zemanta" src="/wp-content/uploads/zemanta.png" alt="" width="415" height="368" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/zemanta.png 989w, /wp-content/uploads/zemanta-300x265.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></a>
</p>

So far, in my composing of this post, it&#8217;s figured out that I would want to link to Zemanta and Lijjit. The suggested links show up on the bottom in little buttons, and then I just click them to create the link. Pretty slick.

I&#8217;m not quite sure why it suggested the images that it did, however&#8230;it pulled this from my Flickr, and I don&#8217;t know why:

<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged" style="margin: 1em; width: 250px; display: block;">
  <div>
    <dl class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 250px;">
      <dt class="wp-caption-dt">
        <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/84661389@N00/18074353"><img title="Mac iifx" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/13/18074353_66a5a35f4b_m.jpg" alt="Mac iifx" width="240" height="180" /></a>
      </dt>

    </dl>
  </div>
</div>

Another thing I realized just now &#8211; if you use WordPress, it seems best to add the images AFTER you have typed all your content, as the cursor is ending up in weird places after I drop an image in&#8230;and then I have to go into HTML mode to get it where it should go.

Oh! I just noticed that Zemanta also suggested some tags for this post, based upon the content. A simple \*click\* added them. That&#8217;s pretty cool.

The final feature I&#8217;m going to try is the &#8220;related articles&#8221; feature. It seems like I can just drag them from the sidebar into my post. Let&#8217;s see&#8230;

Overall, I&#8217;d say that Zemanta seems pretty cool, and given that it&#8217;s free, I would highly recommend checking it out if you&#8217;re a blogger and want a new toy to play with. I&#8217;ll report back on my use of it in a few weeks after I&#8217;ve used it more in my &#8220;day to day&#8221; blogging.
