As you may or may not know, the only true success story out of my college friends has been <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0123102/" target="_blank">Hedy Burress</a>. You might know her from a truly lame Angelina Jolie movie, or perhaps her stint on Boston Common.

Anyway, I just found out that she is in The Shaggs: Philosophy of the World at the Lookingglass. And coincidence of coincidence, a fella who was in DWG just emailed me offering me some comp seats for that show.

Neat.
