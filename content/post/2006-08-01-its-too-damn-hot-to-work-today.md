Granted, my office is air conditioned, but the heat just makes me lethargic. I&#8217;ve accomplished very little today, and I&#8217;m thinking about going home early.

Carrie and Scout left for Michigan this morning &#8211; they&#8217;ll be back on Sunday I&#8217;ve still got Sammy with me until tomorrow night.

Luckily, I&#8217;ve got plenty to do with myself in the mean time. Tonight I will be finishing up the rough cut for Cherie&#8217;s Second City video, and then tomorrow night she&#8217;s coming over so we can finish that up and work on the slideshow. I have a website to do for my friend Mary&#8217;s class reunion (she&#8217;s also the florist for our wedding, so it&#8217;s good to be able to help her out). I also have a bunch of movies that I&#8217;ve wanted to watch that Carrie has no interest in, so I&#8217;ll be taking advantage of my bachelorhood in that way as well.

I really want to start riding my bike again, but it&#8217;s been far too hot. Maybe on Thursday evening I&#8217;ll take it out for a spin.

I was also excited to see that the latest version of the [Flickr Export for iPhoto][1] looks like it takes care of all the things I wanted changed in that tool. It&#8217;s no longer free, but I think i can pony up the couple bucks for it. 

And finally&#8230;goodbye, Greg Maddux. I&#8217;m sorry to see you go.
