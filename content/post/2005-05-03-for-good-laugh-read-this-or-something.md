[**The greatest eBay feedback of all time**][1]

Some samples:

_Remember when you spit in my mouth when I was sleeping? Well, I was awake. A+_

_I was going to leave feedback, but the window&#8217;s open and now I&#8217;m cold._

_I once had a fork. It looked like a spoon, so I called it a spoon. Was I wrong?_

_If you sell cereal and milk separately, I will bid! Otherwse, it will get soggy._
