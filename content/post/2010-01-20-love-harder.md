_The interwebs are a funny place. We make friends we wouldn&#8217;t meet otherwise. We learn about things that otherwise would result in our blissful ignorance. And sometimes&#8230;those two things can combine and we can use the power of routing TCP packets to make a real difference in someone&#8217;s life. Please read on to learn more about how we, the denizens of the webbertubes, can come together and raise up some hope for someone who only wants to love as hard as she can._

## Our Plea

Our friend [brandy][1] is a brilliant writer, a wonderful teacher, and a generous friend.  And she is in love with a man who has just been diagnosed with <a class="zem_slink" title="Multiple myeloma" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma">multiple myeloma</a>.

We are raising money for the Multiple Myeloma Research Fund in his name.  For the price of a cinnamon dolce latte, half-caf, hold the whip, you can be part of an effort to cure a disease that affects approximately 750,000 people worldwide.

Every dollar brings us a dollar closer to a cure.  And every donation brings a sliver of hope to a girl who needs all the hope she can get.

## What You Can Do

**[Give][2]**.  Be part of a worldwide effort to cure a disease that affects approximately 750,000 people worldwide.  Every dollar helps.

**Pass it on.** Forward this story to five people.  Share this blog post.  [Become our fan on Facebook][3].

**Love harder.** Life is short, love is unbending, and no one knows what could happen next.  Tell someone you love them today.

## Where Your Money Goes

  * The American Institute of Philanthropy recently named The <a class="zem_slink" title="Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Myeloma_Research_Foundation">Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation</a> **one of the best organizations** to give to in terms of their accountability and use of resources.
  * By working closely with researchers, clinicians and partners in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry, the MMRF has helped bring multiple myeloma patients four new treatments that are **extending lives around the globe**.
  * The MMRF has advanced twenty Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. They need your support to advance these clinical research programs and accelerate the development of **better, more effective treatments**.
  * The MMRF’s Multiple Myeloma Genomics Initiative recently became **the first to sequence the multiple myeloma whole genome** in its entirety.
  * A whopping 98% of your donation to the MMRF will be used immediately to support **high-priority multiple myeloma research**.
  * With diminishing funding for early stage drug development and the next myeloma treatments not expected to be approved until 2011, the MMRF desperately **needs your help.**

## Brandy’s story

In case you missed it, [brandy shared her story][4] from her point of view right after Christmas.

## The video

Without further ado, I bring you this musical number presented from California, DC, Philadelphia, Ontario, Manitoba, Colorado, Chicago, Tennessee, Halifax, and **many** places in between.  Enjoy!  And sing along :)
