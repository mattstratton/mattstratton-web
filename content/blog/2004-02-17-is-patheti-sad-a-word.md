So someone who will remain nameless (let&#8217;s just call her &#8220;Poultry Chick&#8221;) posted this on a message board:

_So, He called me from Seattle to say, &#8220;Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day&#8221;, and that he was thinking about me today!!!!!! \*swoon\* hehehe&#8230;</p> 

And this is a man who has never even had a real date with me. He never trips up or misses a beat&#8230;. What a romantic God!</i>

For serious? Believe it or not, it wasn&#8217;t on LJ!

Of course, this is the same woman who attributes the quote &#8220;Martinies [sic] are like a woman&#8217;s breasts&#8230;. One is never enough, and Three are too many&#8221; to herself.
