I applied for a photography contributor with [Chicago][1]ist, and need to put together a &#8220;portfolio&#8221; of some of my best pictures of Chicago. The set I am creating is located [here][2] &#8211; I&#8217;ll be adding to it throughout the weekend, so I would sure appreciate it if you all could take a look at them, and leave comments on the images you like best. This will help me a ton.

[Matt&#8217;s Chicago photos][2]

If it helps, this is the description of what Chicagoist is looking for:
  
_Chicagoist loves to bring you photos of our city and our city&#8217;s people. We added the Flickr button so everyone can participate, but we still want to get a photographer of our own for [the Focus feature][3] of the site. Share your photos with us on a weekly basis._

And this is what they emailed me and asked me to provide:
  
_Sample photos. We want to see what kind of style you have and how you capture the city. Send us links to 5 or 7 photos of Chicago that you think are your best work and best capture the essence of Chicago. Remember, this isn&#8217;t always like a photo of the Sears Tower or the marquee on the Chicago Theater. Sometimes it&#8217;s the local bakery or the kids on the corner playing ball. This is the kind of stuff we want._
