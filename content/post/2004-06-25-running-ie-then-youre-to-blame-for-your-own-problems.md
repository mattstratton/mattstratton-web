 <span class="postbody">There are very few good reasons to use IE these days. You get mondo spyware invasion, and <a class="postlink" href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox" target="_blank">Firefox</a> just release 0.9, which is fast, free, and fab.</span>

This has nothing to do with any kind of /. &#8220;Micro$oft is evil and only free open source stuff rules!&#8221; action. IE is junk that is bloated and dangerous to run. And it seems like everyone I talk to who has problems with their Windows PC is crammed to the gills with spyware that came to them via the wonder of IE.

(Or the wonder of Kazaa&#8230;but again, said spyware generally installs itself INTO IE)
