**1. Who was your best friend?** Clint Wenk

**2. What sports did you play?** I ran cross-country my freshman and soph years.

**3. What kind of car did you drive?** 1973 Chevelle, baby. Monkey-shit brown with a ballistic hubcap.

**4. It&#8217;s Friday night, where were you at?** Bowling or at the movies with Schultz. Or working on our &#8220;underground&#8221; school paper, _The Truth._ Yeah, you heard me right, Dottie. I was a rebel.

**5. Were you a party animal?** We drank a lot of Mountain Dew. We were really into caffeine.

**6. Were you in the &#8220;In Crowd&#8221;?** See question 5 above.

**7. Ever skip school?** On &#8220;Ditch Day&#8221; senior year. We skipped school to go to breakfast and then played golf. The dorky part? Clint and I actually went to school BEFORE school that day to drop off an English paper.

**8. Ever smoke?** Sadly, yes. And smokes were only $1.25 a pack. Although I smoked about two cigarettes a day.

**9. Were you a nerd?** I was pretty nerdy. I dressed well though. I was probably one of the least nerdy nerds.

**10. Did you get suspended/expelled?** I had an in-school suspension for one day my freshman year for getting into a fight with Dave Leadingham in the cafeteria. I think it was because he put tartar sauce in my Geometry textbook.

**11. Can you sing the Alma Mater?**
  
_Fight, Roman Warriors
  
Onward to victory in the game
  
Fight for the honor
  
To always something something our name (bomp bomp bomp)
  
Willowbrook High School
  
Is proud to be cheering you to victory
  
So&#8230;we want you to know&#8230;we&#8217;ll fight til we reach our goal._

**12. Who was your favorite teacher?** Ralph Amelio (Cinema), Starsiak (Forensics coach), or Drennan (theatre)

**13. Favorite class?** Brit Lit with Cavanaugh. Totally fun.

**14. What was your school&#8217;s full name?** Willowbrook High School

**15. School mascot?** Willy the Warrior

**16. Did you go to Prom?** I went my senior year. It&#8217;s a complicated story, but I went with this girl Julie from theatre, who I barely knew. I didn&#8217;t see her again until a few years ago when she auditioned for _Dancing With Gaia_.

**17. If you could go back and do it over, would you?** Probably not. It was definitely a fun time, overall, but tempered with so much drama drama and dumb bullshit. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s over, but I&#8217;m glad it happened, because it made me who I am.

**18. What do you remember most about graduation?** Honestly, not a damn thing.

**19. Favorite memory of your Senior Year?** Probably directing my one-act (&#8220;Impromptu&#8221;).

**20. Were you ever posted up on the senior wall?** I think this is a made-up thing. However, I have gone back and seen my picture from some plays is posted on the auditorium wall. That&#8217;s cool.

**21. Did you have a job your senior year?** I worked at Sherwin-Williams selling paint.

**22. Who did you date?** I don&#8217;t think I really dated during high school. I had a messed up &#8220;relationship&#8221; with this girl Jamie (who, incidentally, was the niece of the chief of police). Oh, and I had a great girlfriend the summer of 91 &#8211; she was two years older than me, which was hot.

**23. Where did you go most often for lunch?** The cafeteria. We couldn&#8217;t leave campus.

**24. Have you gained weight since then?** Totally. I weighed about 165 in high school. A few years ago, my friend Jay was looking at old pictures from high school, and he (quite seriously) asked me if I&#8217;d had a nose job. I explained that no, I hadn&#8217;t, but my face had just gotten a lot fatter.

**25. What did you do after graduation?** Nothing thrilling. I think I went to Jay&#8217;s house for a cookout and some cake.
