For purposes of this poll, we shall use Dante&#8217;s definition, not Veronica&#8217;s.

Nobody can see the results but me. I think, but am not sure, that you can vote anonymously. If nothing else, this is a test to see if anon voting in a poll works.

I promise to not tell anyone your number, but after the poll is over, I will post the numerical results (i.e., percentages, etc). Thoughts?
