So I had an interview today with a small consulting company downtown. They had posted something on Craiglist, and wanted to talk to me.

I went in, and had a great conversation with the interviewer. He liked my skills and the job description seemed like a great fit. Basically, they do server/network consulting with a lot of small firms downtown, and it would be an interesting, not-the-same-thing-every-day job.

After talking for a while, he asks me &#8220;So what kind of a rate are you looking for?&#8221;

I replied &#8220;Probably about thirty-eight.&#8221;

&#8220;Thirty-eight a year?&#8221; he asked.

&#8220;No, 38 an hour is my contracting rate,&#8221; I answered. (When someone says &#8220;rate&#8221; it usually means hourly to me.)

He answered &#8220;Um, that&#8217;s a little&#8230;no, a lot more than we were hoping to pay for this position.&#8221;

Turns out they were looking for someone lower level to handle some of the lower end stuff while their main guys were tied up in projects. But he was really excited about me and said he was going to talk to his boss to see if they could convert the position into a higher level one and bring me on board. Hopefully I&#8217;ll hear from him later today.

At the same time, I got another possibility with Bank One. A headhunter called me this morning about a job with them here in Chicago &#8211; I forwarded it on to my friend Jeff to see if he knew who it was with (hoping he could put in a good word for me). After a little confusion, he tracked it down and I got this email:

_Yo,</p> 

I spoke with M\_____ H__\_\\_\_, the \****/Bank One account manager. The job is a combination of Windows Production and Windows Implementation Engineer on the CAS team. I sit one aisle away from this team and know a few of them pretty well. M\_\_\____ is passing on your resume with my name as a reference, so I imagine they will talk to me soon. I&#8217;ll let you know.

I hope one of these pans out. Preferably the Bank One gig.
