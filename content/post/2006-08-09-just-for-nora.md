Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, is visiting Pittsburgh:

> Pittsburgh always rates high on quality of life surveys. So they must be doing something right. I assume that part of Pittsburgh’s strategy involves discouraging tourism by naming their sports teams Pirates and Steelers. It sounds like the kind of place where unless you stuff your wallet up your own ass and clench, someone is going to get it. 

I know that Nora&#8217;s from Philly, not Pittsburgh, but any time I read anything about ass-clenching, it makes me think of her. So I figured it was close enough.
