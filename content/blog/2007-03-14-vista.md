My upgrade copy of Vista from Dell arrived today (since my work laptop was purchased in the last quarter of 2006, I was eligible for an upgrade DVD for the low low cost of ten bucks shipping). I&#8217;m not exactly ready to &#8220;ride the wire&#8221; and upgrade my work laptop (especially not during the week that I&#8217;m working at home since I&#8217;m on-call), so I&#8217;m installing it into a VM on my laptop.

I was pleasantly impressed with how quickly the installation process went&#8230;until I sat and stared at this screen for thirty minutes:

Then, after that, it launched this screen (which was the screen that it showed before it rebooted and hung out at the &#8220;preparing to start for the first time&#8230;&#8221; deal:

I guess the thing that annoys me is that I have NO IDEA what it&#8217;s doing. Of course, previous installations for Windows weren&#8217;t much better&#8230;how long did it take 98 to &#8220;install Start Menu Items&#8221;, anyway?
