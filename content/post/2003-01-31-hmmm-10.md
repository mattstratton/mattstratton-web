So I&#8217;ve got a new interest&#8230;maybe.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; Gaga Girl #1 is still in the running, even though that will never ever happen. And I&#8217;m not &#8220;gaga&#8221; over this new interest &#8211; we just had a date (I think), and it was fun.

Problem is, none of my friends like her. Which seems to be a trend lately&#8230;most of my friends are not too fond of Gaga Girl #1 (Gaga Girl #2 is a different story).

I really am a little confused. But I&#8217;m not gonna sweat it, because I&#8217;ve got a fucking J-O-B, finally!
