So it seems that spam is gender-neutral&#8230;

Or at least equal-opportunity.

For a while there, I was feeling bad for women. There was all this spam about enlarging one&#8217;s penis&#8230;but nothing about the female genitalia.

Now, however, it seems that spam regarding Kegel exercises is all the rage.

And with that, women everywhere win.
