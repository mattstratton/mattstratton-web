[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5635" title="rtfm" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/rtfm.png" alt="rtfm" width="180" height="296" />][1]My good pal Jenn at Free and Flawed is having a super awesome contest. She&#8217;s <a href="http://freeandflawed.com/2009/11/17/hp-pavilion-dm3-giveaway" target="_blank">giving away</a> a new <a href="http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/thinandlight/dm3.html" target="_blank">HP Pavilion dm3 laptop</a> to one lucky commenter on her blog. I highly recommend you enter her contest, which simply entails commenting on <a href="http://freeandflawed.com/2009/11/17/hp-pavilion-dm3-giveaway" target="_blank">this post</a> and sharing your (hopefully) embarrassing &#8220;first screen name ever&#8221;.

Right now you&#8217;re probably saying to yourself &#8220;Self, Matt already has a bajillion computers. Why in the heck would he want ANOTHER computer?&#8221;

The answer is quite simple. As you most likely are aware, my lovely wife <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mugsy/sets/72157622695099405/" target="_blank">Carrie</a> is pregnant with twins. She also is lacking in the laptop department. Once these boys come, it&#8217;s going to be pretty difficult for her to use her desktop computer, what with running around and chasing them. Plus, you know, all that breastfeeding. The solution to this is&#8230;new laptop! And a free laptop would be even better.

Were I to be the lucky recipient of this fancy-pants new lappy, it would have some pretty sweet usage in our house. Not only would Carrie be able to check Facebook, which is, of course, super important, but she&#8217;d be able to catch up on some quick emails no matter where in the house she was. Plus, once she&#8217;s mobile with her computing, maybe we&#8217;ll finally get her on the Twitter. I doubt it, but stranger things have happened.

I&#8217;m also hoping that Carrie will want to contribute to the upcoming blog for our boys (domain name acquired, but not set up yet&#8230;watch this space for updates). The less she has to trudge up the stairs to her computer to write a quick post, the more likely she is to actually post. And trust me, as her one guest post here proved, you want Carrie blogging. It would make you all very happy. And you like to be happy, don&#8217;t you?

In conclusion, I must stress that **my desire to win this laptop is almost completely selfless**. The only benefit I gain from winning it is not having to actually shell out the money to buy one for my wife. And then I could use that money to send my sons to college. So, ultimately, I am the most deserving person ever of winning a free laptop. True story.
