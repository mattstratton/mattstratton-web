So I got to thinking today.

It seems that a lot of folks I am friendly with don&#8217;t like each other. Especially on Yehoodi. At least three times a week I get an IM from a friend bitching about someone else who is a friend of mine.

It made me start to wonder. Did you ever wonder what people say about you behind your back? There&#8217;s no way to ever know. Not sure you&#8217;d WANT to know. But I think i&#8217;m mostly curious because it&#8217;s one of those things that you can never truly have an answer for.

Unless you put a tape recorder in a briefcase and leave it behind at a meeting.
