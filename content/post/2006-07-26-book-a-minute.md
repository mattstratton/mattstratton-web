Don&#8217;t have much time to read? Just catch up with [<u>Book-A-Minute</u>][1].

> _The Fellowship of the Ring_
  
> By J. R. R. Tolkien
> 
> **Gandalf**
> 
> Bilbo Baggins, your Ring is evil. In a couple decades, we&#8217;ll try to destroy it. In the meantime, leave it for Frodo to play with.
> 
> **Bilbo Baggins**
> 
> It&#8217;s not evil. It&#8217;s mine. My precious. Mine! MINE, I TELL YOU!! MOOHOOHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
> 
> (Frodo takes it to RIVENDELL. Some FRIENDS come with him. They are attacked by black riders a LOT, and it is SCARY.)
> 
> **Elrond**
> 
> Frodo Baggins, if Sauron ever gets this Ring, the world will be destroyed, and evil will reign forever. We must act quickly. Take the Ring to where he lives.
> 
> (They do some travelling. Some more FRIENDS come with him. Gandalf DIES in the mines of Moria, but will later be RESURRECTED in GLORIFIED form having triumphed over EVIL, an obvious literary ALLUSION to that movie where the guy comes back as a DOG.)
> 
> **Boromir**
> 
> Frodo Baggins, give me the Ring.
> 
> **Frodo**
> 
> No.
> 
> **Boromir**
> 
> What have I done? (dies)
> 
> THE END 

The <u>[one for the _Sweet Valley High_ series][2]</u> was good too.
