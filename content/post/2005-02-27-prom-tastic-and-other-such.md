Yesterday I met up with a bunch of folks for brunch for Amy W&#8217;s birthday. It was kind of funny; with the exception of Amy&#8217;s friend Stephen (who we all met for the first time there), I was the only boy. To add amusement to injury, while we were waiting for a table, a group of guys including Josh, Matt P, and Chiv all walked by on their way for a day of shopping.

But the funniest part was&#8230;][1] was with them. To give you the backstory, Tommy and I have never met. The joke is that the universe would explode if we did&#8230;or that we are the same person &#8211; since we always &#8220;keep missing each other&#8221; like Clark Kent and Superman. But anyway, it was a real pleasure to finally meet the man.

Brunch was fun &#8211; however, I still haven&#8217;t had a good piece of bacon in this city. But the girls promised to help me find proper bacon one day.

After brunch, and Nicole and I went to see _Sideways_. I really enjoyed it, although I think I understand why Chris didn&#8217;t. I do think it&#8217;s getting a little over-hyped; it was a great film, but to some people, it seems like it&#8217;s the Second Coming of Cinema. It&#8217;s not. It is a little heavy handed with some metaphors, and sometimes the cinematography is a little too manipulative for my tastes. But the performances are GREAT, and most of the photography is fantastic.

After the movie, and I hustled home, and then headed up to WaNoHoMoFloJo for and &#8216;s 80&#8217;s Prom Party.

It was great. I was all Ducky-ed up (ala _Pretty In Pink_), and everyone else looked fantastic too. Great music, fun drinks&#8230;and some drunk shenanagins. Although not by me. I was shenanagan free.
