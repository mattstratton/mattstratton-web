My boss just came by my desk to talk about Lou Piniella, and while he was here, told me that he just sent in the order for my new laptop. Hopefully it should be approved next week, which means I&#8217;ll be getting it relatively soon.

He ordered me the &#8220;developer&#8221; version, which is 2 GB of RAM, dual core, and a 17&#8243; LCD monitor. I think it has a DVD burner in it too. That&#8217;s neat. It&#8217;ll be an upgrade from my 512 MB of RAM and 2.2 Ghz P4.

Last night Carrie and I went over to Jessica&#8217;s house to try to figure out what was wrong with her cable interweb &#8211; turns out the cable modem is broken, so she has to get it replaced. Once she gets that taken care of, I am going to reformat her laptop (it&#8217;s got more spyware than I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life) and get her all good to go.

After we got back from Jessica&#8217;s, Heather called me with a computer question &#8211; &#8220;What could cause my computer to not turn on?&#8221; After I snidely replied that it was probably not plugged in, we determined that I was going to have to come take a look at it. That will be tonight after work. She has a 2 year old eMachines computer, and I&#8217;m thinking that it&#8217;s probably the power supply &#8211; which will pretty much result in me prescribing that she just buy a new computer.

Sometimes I hate being known as the technical one.
