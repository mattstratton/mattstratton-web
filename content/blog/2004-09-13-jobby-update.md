So today the guy from Commerical sent me an IM asking if I was still interested&#8230;I guess there&#8217;s been a problem with the guy they made an offer to (the gossip is that he didn&#8217;t pass the background check) so he said that if HR told him that it was a no-go with that guy, did I still want the job?

I talked to my boss, who happened to be in town today. He said that if I wanted it, he wouldn&#8217;t stop me, but he would want me to keep working on my projects and stuff until we got my replacement hired and trained (which the guy from Commercial said was okay). He also said he probably would have a permanent job in the next month or so.

I talked to some other people at work, and nobody has anything good to say about my boss. Apparently he&#8217;s been known to kind of weasel out of stuff in the past. So I decided to tell the Commercial team I am interested.

Now we just have to see what HR says about that other guy. Good news is, even if I don&#8217;t get that gig, my boss probably doesn&#8217;t hate me, so I should have a job one way or another.
