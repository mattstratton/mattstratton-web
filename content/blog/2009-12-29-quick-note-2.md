I don&#8217;t have time to write a full-on post right now, since I&#8217;m in the last-minute updates before <a href="https://strattonboys.com/were-on-the-schedule" target="_blank">my boys are born tomorrow morning</a>&#8230;but I wanted to at least share this amusing Facebook update from my friend Scott:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5742" title="tickets" src="/wp-content/uploads/tickets.jpg" alt="" width="528" height="60" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/tickets.jpg 528w, /wp-content/uploads/tickets-300x34.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" />][1]

Keep that in mind while you&#8217;re traveling for the New Year holiday. I&#8217;m hoping to have a bunch of fun pictures and updates to post sometime tomorrow after the boys show up&#8230;but until then&#8230;hold tight!
