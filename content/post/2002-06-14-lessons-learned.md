Went to IO last night with Tracy to see her friend Laura.

I thought it was a Harold show, but it was not&#8230;it was something called &#8220;Slugfest&#8221;. From what I understand, it&#8217;s two people doing&#8230;well&#8230;whatever. I guess it can be standup, performance art, or whatnot.

The first performer was Michael Perry&#8230;this was the show that Laura was in. He did a kind of multimedia sketch comedy thing &#8211; she played the author of _The Vagina Monologues_ that he was auditioning with, complete with a vagina sock puppet. That was pretty funny.

The second performer was Susan Barrett. She did an amazing one-woman show&#8230;first, it was incredibly clever. Second, she had the most dynamically comedic face I&#8217;ve seen in a long time. And a wonderful committment to the comedy. She tooks risks, owned them, and that brought the audience to her side.

I sat there, stunned, at the end. I turned to Tracy and said &#8220;Dammit, I wish I was casting a project right now!&#8221; and she said &#8220;I knew it! I was watching and I thought &#8216;I bet Matt wants to cast her&#8217;.&#8221;

So the lessons learned:

1) Always carry business cards

2) Always have a project

I had neither, so I didn&#8217;t talk to her. But I got her name. Hopefully Dallas will write something we could use her for. And if so, hopefully she&#8217;d be interested in discussing hitching her wagon to our star for a few days.
