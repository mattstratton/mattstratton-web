First, it appears that I have outsmarted myself.

Our master for DWG is on Digital Betacam. Which is a great format, high quality, and all that rot.

Problem is (as I discovered yesterday), barely _anyone_ has Digibeta decks. Most importantly, not the guy who is going to author our DVD. So I decided to look into renting a Digibeta deck for the process.

They&#8217;re between $500-$700 per **day**. Eep! Plus, they don&#8217;t have Firewire out (because the output is too much info), so I&#8217;d need to get an SDI to Firewire box. Double eep!

So basically, I&#8217;m going to have to pay (who knows how much) to get the film transferred from the digibeta to miniDV. Yargh.

Other news&#8230;Dallas is down at [SXSW][1] this week, and making all kinds of new friends. He&#8217;s gotten to be smoking buddies (cigarettes, natch) with some dude from AFI, and got into a 45 minute long discussion about physics with Marla Halperin of Magic Lamp last night. Upshot? She wants to see DWG. Eep!
