Thanks to everyone who offered me help updating my resume and such. Unfortunately, I just found out that the job I was hoping for has no interest in me due to my (lack of) academic qualifications. So it&#8217;s back to square one. Luckily, square one currently means &#8220;a job that pays well with good benefits and four weeks of vacation&#8221;, so it&#8217;s not terrible.

The thing is, from the get-go I had a feeling that this was going to be the case, but I foolishly let myself get my hopes up. I&#8217;m usually a little better at being cynical and realistic.
