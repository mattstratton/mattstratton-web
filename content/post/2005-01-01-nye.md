You know, it&#8217;s pretty cool when a really hot girl makes out with you on New Years Eve and then, a little bit later, says &#8220;You know&#8230;you are a really hot kisser.&#8221;

The part that sucks is when she follows it up by saying &#8220;&#8230;but I have a date tonight.&#8221;

Patience, dear Mugsy. Patience.

Happy New Year, my friends!
