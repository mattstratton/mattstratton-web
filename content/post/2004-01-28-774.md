On Super Bowl Sunday, Apple and Pepsi will launch a historic promotion to legally give away 100 million free songs to Mac and Windows PC users from Apple&#8217;s iTunes Music Store &#8212; the world&#8217;s number one digital music service. Beginning February 1, 100 million winning codes will be randomly seeded in 20-ounce and 1-liter bottles of Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Sierra Mist, and the winning codes will be redeemable for a free song from the iTunes Music Store. Winners will simply go to Apple&#8217;s iTunes Music store (<a href="http://www.iTunes.com" target="_blank">www.iTunes.com</a>), enter the code found under the bottle cap and choose any 99 cent song from the online store&#8217;s vast catalog of over 500,000 songs. The promotion will run until March 31, 2004.
