So I came home from a great date with the improv chick, and was in a fantastic mood.

And then I discover that a few hours earlier, I had an IM from a friend of mine.

I&#8217;m not going to go into the details of it, because this friend seems to think that everyone talks about them in their blogs, and I don&#8217;t want more drama. But let&#8217;s just say that this was the last straw. It was an incredibly impersonal way to tell me something that should have been very personal.

I&#8217;m so glad that I&#8217;m moving. Every day it seems like people who I thought were my friends are turning out to disappoint me. Maybe I&#8217;m the disappointment.
