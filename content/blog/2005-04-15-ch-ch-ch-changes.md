I heard a rumor about this last week, but I just got the official word.

I am moving from a Production Support role back to an implementation/project-oriented role here at the bank. I&#8217;ll still be working in the same group, but doing different stuff.

Basically, in the &#8220;old world&#8221;, my boss, Jim, was the head of the Production Support team (for both Unix and Windows) for the Commercial Bank. There were about eight of us, and our job was to basically fix shit that got broken. And for the Windows guys, to do a lot of patching.

In the &#8220;new world&#8221;, Jim is now in charge of Wintel for TSS (which is like Commercial but different). He now lords over 29 people. There are two pieces of his new group &#8211; &#8220;Infrastructure Operations&#8221;, which is the old &#8220;Production Support&#8221; group, and a smaller group, &#8220;Service Delivery and Improvement&#8221; &#8211; which is a project-oriented group.

I am now in the Service Delivery and Improvement group. So technically, Jim is still my boss, but now there is a new manager in between us. Plus, I&#8217;m the only one on this new team in Chicago. This may result in more opportunities to work remotely, or hell, even relocate (only two people on my team are even in the same city as each other).

Neat stuff!
