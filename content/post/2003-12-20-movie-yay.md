I&#8217;ve really been looking forward to seeing _The Cooler_, and I just saw that it is playing at a couple theaters here in Chicago&#8230;I think I&#8217;ll try to go see it tomorrow.

My &#8220;movie a day&#8221; project kind of died, due to Sonic Death Flu. I am going to try it again in January.
