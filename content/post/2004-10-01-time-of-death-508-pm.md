Too little, too late.

That&#8217;s the best way to summarize today&#8217;s game.

This team has completely fallen apart. At least offensively. They rallied in the 9th, but it wasn&#8217;t enough.

They&#8217;re not out of it yet&#8230;they have a tiny tiny chance, but it&#8217;s going to require them to win the next two, and both the Giants and the Astros have to lose 2 of the next three.

So in other words, barring large infections of plague on both teams, they&#8217;re screwed.
