<font color="red"><b>Marcelo:</b></font> YOUR MOM IS NOT A JOKE.
  
<font color="red"><b>Marcelo:</b></font> Matt, you don&#8217;t know about your mom. I do. I&#8217;ve done the research, Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt, you don&#8217;t even&#8211; you&#8217;re glib. You don&#8217;t even know what your mom is.If you start talking about your mom, you have to evaluate and read the research papers on how they came up with these moms, Matt, okay. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done. Then you go and you say where&#8217;s&#8211; where&#8217;s the funny? Where&#8217;s the funny that says how big of a mom you&#8217;re supposed to get?
