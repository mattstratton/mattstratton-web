Wow, lots to talk about today&#8230;I think I&#8217;ll start with the update on Clint&#8217;s wedding.

Friday evening I flew out to OKC. Completely uneventful flight. Got to my gate almost two hours before takeoff, thanks to the hint Rak gave me (here&#8217;s what it is&#8230;if you&#8217;re at the American terminal at O&#8217;Hare&#8230;walk **all** the way down to your right to the enterance to &#8220;L&#8221; and &#8220;G&#8221; gates&#8230;there&#8217;s a separate security checkpoint there and NOBODY is every using it (since &#8220;H&#8221; and &#8220;K&#8221; gates are the more popular), but you can reach ANY gate in the terminal from that checkpoint).

Got my rental car upgraded from an Escort to a Mustang. Checked into my room (I forgot how CRAPPY Red Roof Inn is), and made it an early night. Talked to , which was nice.

Saturday, drove into Norman to meet up with everyone. Had breakfast at the Residence Inn with the people who were staying there, then headed out to some batting cages and go-carts with the guys (to take Clint&#8217;s mind off of the stress). Had fun there. I hit some balls. Raced some go-carts and it was a really free and reckless feeling. Then it started to rain.

The cermony was nice. I think it was a Methodist church. I confess that all Protestant sects kind of run together for me, so I don&#8217;t really know. They talked about Jesus a lot.

Reception was at the Museum of Natural History. VERY cool idea, I must say. First wedding I&#8217;ve been to where there was not &#8220;assigned&#8221; seating for dinner, which made me a little uncomfortable, because I really didn&#8217;t know anyone there who was not sitting at the head table (the guest list was very &#8220;Lindsay-heavy&#8221;). But I ended up at table with this guy named Jack (who I&#8217;d met at the bachelor party) and his fiancee. Pretty good reception, but I left kinda early because I was getting a little bored.

Sunday I was supposed to go to a brunch being held at Lindsay&#8217;s parents&#8217; house, but when I woke up and saw the horrible flood-level rain they were expecting all down Route 35 for &#8220;later this afternoon&#8221;, I decided to start my drive to Dallas in the morning. It wasn&#8217;t too bad; the first 45 minutes or so were in pretty heavy rain, but it cleared up somewhat for the remainder.

Jess and I went out to dinner at Houston&#8217;s (a steakhouse) and I learned a couple things there.

1) Texas has weird laws about having some kind of supplemental ID called a &#8220;Unicard&#8221; or something.

2) Apparently, Chicago is known for our spinach-artichoke dip

A very tasty meal with wonderful company. I had a really good time.

We finished up by going to see Ricky Derek (I keep hearing &#8220;Rick Derris&#8221; is my head), who was a lounge singer covering Ol&#8217; Blue Eyes. He was a lot of fun. Kind of like Brien Perry, except white, not as big, and without the eyepatch.

Because I was scared of having to drive back through flash flooding, I changed my flight so that I flew out of DFW instead. Cost me a hundred bucks, but it was worth it for the peace of mind, I figured. Until I woke up yesterday and saw that it was BEAUTIFUL out&#8230;would have been no problem to drive to OKC. Oh well.

There&#8217;re some other things going on in my head because of this weekend&#8230;I&#8217;ll post a separate entry for them shortly.
