OK, so maybe I should have looked at this stuff more closely before we booked it, but I am just over the moon with how cool some of our accommodations in Costa Rica will be.

Here&#8217;s what our room looks like for the first night, at the Peace Lodge:

Check out the bathroom!

The next two nights are in the superior room at Tabacon.

In addition to our forest & garden room amenities, these rooms offer plush cotton bathrobes and a breathtaking view of the Arenal volcano, especially perfect for those who wish to view the volcano at night. Superior rooms have been recently remodeled, and now they offer DVDs, new furnishings and additional amenities.

Each <b>Superior Room</b> offers both ocean and jungle views, private balconies, bathroom with tiled shower, air-conditioning, kitchen or stocked mini-bar, king or queen size beds, ceiling fans, telephone, and security safes.</font>
