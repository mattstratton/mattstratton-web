I&#8217;ve been feeling very &#8220;me against the world&#8221; lately.

I have friends that I talk to, but I can&#8217;t talk to them about things that are important because everyone has big mouths and things always get back to people. I&#8217;ve been known to partake in gossip myself, so I can&#8217;t blame people. But I&#8217;m just smart enough to know what I have to keep back.

I have a business partner who is 6 hours away, working 18 hour days on his doctorate, and has a &#8220;real life&#8221; in his city &#8211; I always feel bad when I call him to talk about business, because I feel like I&#8217;m bugging him. So again, something I feel like I&#8217;m doing myself.

I&#8217;m giving up on trying to make people happy. Every time I do that, they just get mad at me.
