Jaymie and I finally managed to sync up on the phone tonight, and we now have firm plans for a date on Thursday night. We are going to my favorite dive bar for drinks. Seriously, I&#8217;m starting to think that Grant is going to wonder about me bringing in a different girl almost every month. But Parrot&#8217;s is a great litmus test for meeting a girl, seriously.

Some new things I have learned:

She just moved to Uptown from Oak Park last week, so she hasn&#8217;t lived on the North side for quite a while (apparently she used to live in Boystown, but she doesn&#8217;t know the area as well as she used to).

She smokes. But I will NOT let this make me smoke again, I swear.

She&#8217;s a TV nerd just like I am.

Her dog is a girl, and is some kind of Shepard/Rott mix.
