    Saw it last night. Audience loved it. We all cheered. Huge applause at the end of each feature.

    This movie DEFINES &#8220;gratuitous&#8221;. But that&#8217;s what makes it brilliant.

    More later, as I&#8217;ve got a lot to say about it. But I will say this &#8211; the &#8220;missing reel&#8221; gag played brilliantly in <span style="font-style:italic;">Planet Terror</span>. Did not play as well in <span style="font-style:italic;">Death Proof</span>. But quite frankly, this film has the best car chase since <span style="font-style:italic;">The French Connection</span>.
