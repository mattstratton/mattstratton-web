So today was the &#8220;December holiday gift exchange stuff&#8221; at my mom&#8217;s house. My friend [Darlyn][1] came with me, because she couldn&#8217;t go home to her family out of town.

It was a nice day. My mom made lasagna, and Darlyn brought a yummy cobbler. I got a Postal Service CD from my hipster sister, an Avril CD from the other sister, and a couple of books (newest Sedaris and one about sound design), a poker desk calendar, and _The Big Lebowski_ from my mom and stepdad.

Afterwards, we met Brian and Tracy to see Lemony Snicket. A bunch of other folks were a-pposed to meet up with us (which is why we changed the time to go in the evening instead of earlier in the day), but they all cancelled I guess. Either way, it was a fun xmasukah.
