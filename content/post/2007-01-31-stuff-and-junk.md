) who provided excellent advice on wedding registries in my last post. That was pretty neat and helpful.

As far as the honeymoon goes, I think we&#8217;re going to ditch Costa Rica Experts. When I called them on their pricey proposal, the dude said &#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t know you wanted to spend $AMOUNT including airfare.&#8221; He then sent me another proposal which was less, but still over budget, and staying at less nice hotels. We compared it to the proposal we got from [another travel agent][1], which was for the exact same trip, but upgraded rooms, and that one was even cheaper than CRE&#8217;s &#8220;improved&#8221; proposal. So I think that&#8217;s who we are going with.

I also set up a fare watch on Kayak.com for our flights &#8211; already I found one for only $414 each, which is great. It&#8217;s on Spirit Air, which Carrie is a little leery of, but we&#8217;ll see. We still have time, and maybe fares will go down even further. Considering I was expecting between $600-$700 each, that&#8217;s pretty good.

Our big challenge right now is the second half of the honeymoon &#8211; the first part we know. It will be in the Arenal area, and we&#8217;ll be staying at the Tabac√≥n. The second half is the tricky part &#8211; we&#8217;ll either be at Hotel Si Como No in the Manuel Antonio area, or the Allegro Papagayo in [Guanacaste][2]. The first is a bit more of a rain foresty kind of thing (but with a beach nearby), while the second is an all-inclusive resort in a much hotter, drier climate on the beach. Price-wise they&#8217;re withing spitting distance of each other, so it&#8217;s a tough call.

In other news, on Saturday we will be joining a whole host of awesome swing dancing friends for the Swingers Ball out at the Willowbrook Ballroom. It&#8217;s total prom action &#8211; I&#8217;m wearing my tux, Carrie bought a new dress, and we&#8217;re joining up with a crew in a rented limo to get there. Fun!
