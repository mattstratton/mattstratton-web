<span class="mainmenu"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-style:italic;">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</span>.</span></span>

Wes Anderson fans will enjoy this movie. If you don&#8217;t like the Wes, this is \*not\* the movie to change your mind. Anderson doesn&#8217;t fit into common narrative molds, and if you go into this expecting the Bill Murray of <span style="font-style:italic;">Groundhog Day</span> or the Owen Wilson of <span style="font-style:italic;">Zoolander</span>, you&#8217;re going to be sorely disappointed.

The movie is beautifully shot, with some just&#8230;strange CGI. But strange in a good way (in my opinion), Pacing is a little bit off, and the third act is longer than I personally would like, but our man Steve is just so &#8230; interesting, that I didn&#8217;t mind.
