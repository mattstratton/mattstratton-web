For the first three people that reply to this post who re-post this challenge: you win!

I will send you a gift.

It might be something I&#8217;ve made or something I see that I think you will like, or just, well just about damned anything, really. Presents. Don&#8217;t pass em up.

Whatever it is, I promise I will get it to you in 365 days of your posted comment or less (hopefully much less), and I will need your snail mail address.

The only thing you need to do to receive your gift is PARTICIPATE.

Be one of the first three journalers to reply to this with your snail mail address (comments will be screened), and post this very same thing in your journal, and YOU are the lucky giftee.

First gift is for 

<div class="ljuser">

</div>

<div class="ljuser">

</div>

! One gift remains!
