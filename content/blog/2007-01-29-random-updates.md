Busy weekend. Here&#8217;s the recap for yo&#8217; azz:

**Friday**  
After work, I joined&nbsp;

on the Metra to head out to the suburbs. He and

&nbsp;both felt that it would be good practice for when we move out there. We met up with

&nbsp;and Carrie for dinner at Uncle Julio&#8217;s, and then stopped at Baker&#8217;s Square for some pie. We took the pie back to their house and played Cranium. Then we went home.

**Saturday**  
The day started off well. We went to [Costa Rica Experts][1] (a travel agent recommended by a friend) to get information to book our honeymoon. I told the dude that we had a hard limit budget (I gave him the number) and said that I needed that number to include everything &#8211; including airfare. He told me that would be no problem. Basically, I said &#8220;here&#8217;s what we can spend, and here&#8217;s what we want to do, so tell me how many days we can do it for&#8221;. We talked about the areas we wanted to visit, the activities we wanted to do, and he said he&#8217;d get us a proposal.

Well, later that day, he emailed me the proposal &#8211; it did NOT include airfare, and was just a couple hundred dollars lower than our budget. Which means once airfare was included, it would be about $700 or so HIGHER than our budget. I was pretty pissed &#8211; he didn&#8217;t even acknowledge that he went over the parameters I gave him. Carrie did a little fishing around online, and priced out the places he listed, and the activities, and found out that the total price was less than half of what he quoted. Granted, her prices did not include ground transportation, but I really doubt that a couple puddle jumper flights will cost us $1,900. I&#8217;m a little pissed. Carrie is contacting another travel agent we&#8217;d gotten some quotes from who was much more reasonable.

After our travel agent meeting, we joined

&nbsp;for brunch at Eleven City Diner. Had some delicious lox. Plus, they have a dish called the [&#8220;Tom Waits Breakfast&#8221;][2]. Neat.

Saturday night we stayed in and watched _The Devil Wears Prada_ on On Demand.

**Sunday**  
This was a busy day &#8211; we started by meeting Carrie&#8217;s friends [Angie][3] and [Brian][4] for brunch at Orange on Harrison. After brunch, we went to church with them, and then headed out to the suburbs for Wedding Madness. First we went to [Style on a Budget][5] to talk about invitations. We were super thrilled with them &#8211; the invitations will look totally spiffy, and are under our budget. We also are going to have her do our programs.

After the invitations, we went to Bed Bath and Beyond to register. That was exhausting. We were there for two hours, and only got about halfway done. We&#8217;re going back next Sunday &#8211; in addition to registering at Crate and Barrel that day as well.

After registering, we had dinner at my mom&#8217;s house and I geeked out over Tom Waits with my stepfather.
