So my friend hosts a Hurry Date thingy here&#8230;she emailed me because they are short on guys tonight, and she wants me to go. So I told her I would if I could get another fella to go with me&#8230;

&#8230;which is when I realized that almost none (actually, I think it literally is none) of my male friends that are local are single.

I AM THE LOSER! Mwahahahaha!
