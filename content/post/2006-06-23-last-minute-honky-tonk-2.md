If any of you are around tonight looking for something cool, don&#8217;t miss the [Hoyle Brothers][1] playing with Dale Watson at [Martyr&#8217;s][2] (3855 N. Lincoln).

The show starts at 9 PM, and is $12. Carrie and I will be there. I know it&#8217;s not as cool as a Bonnie Raitt concert, but it&#8217;s a lot closer :)
