So tomorrow night is my Secret Squirrel Birthday Party.

I have no idea what is planned. Chris and Tracy (and others) have put this whole thing together &#8211; all I did was tell them the date and who to invite.

I&#8217;m pretty excited. Although Chris keeps saying things that scare me, like &#8220;we&#8217;re taking a big gamble with this &#8211; you&#8217;re either love it, or we won&#8217;t be friends anymore&#8221;. But I think maybe he&#8217;s just messing with my head.

Just found out that Ferret Girl is not coming to the party. I don&#8217;t really know who is actually coming (the evite is not for me to see), but she&#8217;s the third &#8220;no show&#8221; I&#8217;ve heard this week. Darlyn is apparently going to the opera, Ferret Girl has a thing for her dad, and Rak decided he&#8217;d rather go to the Xmas party for his investment club.

Oh well. I know that my good friends will be there. And regardless, I&#8217;m super happy and excited that I have awesome friends willing to do all this work for my birthday. Yay for you guys.
