So my cube/desk is getting a little less than optimal in terms of layout and design. I would like to figure out an ideal situation for my little work-house.

If you would like to offer up your opinions, please click through.

First of all, some background as to WHERE my cube is. I am at the end of a row up against a wall (and yes, I have a &#8220;window&#8221;, sort of). The two cubes in front of mine are where my staff sits &#8211; the cube opposite mine is the DBA manager, and the other row is made up of DBAs. Here you can see how our row looks:

Here&#8217;s an overview of my cube:

To the left of the picture above is the &#8220;front&#8221; of the cube (what faces out towards the main aisle). &#8220;Behind&#8221; the camera is the aisle between the cubes. To the right is the wall/window.

This is my main work area:

I have a laptop in a docking station that connects to my large, wide-screen monitor. The display on the laptop is kind of cruddy (1024&#215;768) but my monitor is much nicer (1680 x 1050). On the bottom left, you can see the file cabinet in my cube, which consists of two desk-type drawers and one full-sized drawer for hanging files.

Now something annoying:

If you look closely, you can see that the bracket holding up my desk is right underneath my laptop. If I sit squarely so that my legs are under my laptop, sometimes I bump my knee against this bracket, which hurts. There is a similar bracket on the right side of the desk, which is under my phone, but I haven&#8217;t bumped into it yet.

Here&#8217;s the other side of my desk:

I know, it&#8217;s a mess. But you can see that I have a phone, and actually a fair amount of desk space that is being used as, well, &#8220;near-line storage&#8221; (read: &#8220;a place to put junk I haven&#8217;t figured out what to do with yet&#8221;)

And finally, the &#8220;back&#8221; of my cube:

[<img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3173/2345917780_4903e128e7.jpg" alt="Back of cube" width="500" height="375" />][6]

I put this picture in here to illustrate that I don&#8217;t really have room behind me, and definitely no space to hang anything.

So first of all, I want to figure out how to lay-out my phone, monitor, laptop, mouse, and keyboard for optimal use. Right now I&#8217;m not really leveraging my monitor (I still end up doing most of my stuff on the laptop display, which seems wasteful). I have it set up to span the desktop, because mirroring it seems like a waste (the big monitor would be at 1024 resolution then) and to just have it display on the monitor alone takes away from multi-monitor, which I really like having.

I have larger organization issues as well (which are apparent). Any feedback or suggestions for optimization of ANY of this workspace would be appreciated.
