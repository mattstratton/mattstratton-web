Carrie and I had dinner tonight with her parents as an early birthday celebration (they are going out of town and won&#8217;t be around near her birthday). When she was out walking the dog, I took the opportunity to tell her mom and dad what I had planned for her birthday weekend. They loved the idea of the NYC trip. I then said &#8220;Also, with your blessing, I would like to ask her to marry me that weekend.&#8221;

They are totally on board, and love the entire plan. And they promised to not tell anyone, especially Carrie&#8217;s sisters, so that a) the secret doesn&#8217;t get out, and b) Carrie can surprise everyone by telling them the story after it happens.

Things are going exceptionally well with the plan. I&#8217;m very happy.
