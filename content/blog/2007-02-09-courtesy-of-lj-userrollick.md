> <span style="font-style:italic;">I attended the same high school as you, so this is a question you should be uniquely qualified to answer. (By the way, Mr. Anthony still talks about you.) When you meet a man who is a total hottie but also a consummate pussy, how best to seduce him? Alcohol is a good standby, but tends to make the sex bad. Assuming he is willing but a coward, what would you do?</span>

What&#8217;s wrong with you? What is up with women who want guys that are pussies? How about a real MAN? How about that? Good-looking pretty boys are for boys. I&#8217;m sorry, Anna. But you needed to hear that.

I swear, it seems like today I&#8217;m just posting things for[<img style="border:0 none;vertical-align:bottom;" src="https://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" width="17" height="17" />][1][**scrapplequeen**][2]&#8216;s amusement.
