OK, so I&#8217;m going through and configurating and installermating stuff on my new work laptop. And it&#8217;s a pain, because I always forget the cool stuff that I find indispensable. And my old laptop is shut off and locked away in a cabinet, so I can&#8217;t fire it up and see what I had installed. Well, I could, except that would require some effort.

Anyway, I need some tips and suggestions as for some tools that you guys all think are really useful. I&#8217;ll start off by listing the things that I already got (this will be useful in the future for me as well, so I don&#8217;t have to go through this again).

  * [Firefox][1]
  * [GAIM][2]
  * [Google Desktop][3]
  * [NotesBuddy][4] (feature-rich client for Sametime)
  * [iTunes][5]
  * [PINS][6] (password manager)

I also have the following Fx extensions:

  * [Deepest Sender][7] (LJ client)
  * [del.icio.us][8] (bookmark manager)
  * [Fasterfox][9]
  * [Google Browser Sync][10]
  * [Greasemonkey][11]
  * [Nightly Tester Tools][12] (for extension compatibility)
  * Filterset.G Updater (auto updater for Adblock Plus)
  * [Adblock Plus][13]
  * BBCode
  * [FaviconizeTab][14]
  * [IE Tab][15]

And here are the Greasemonkey scripts I have:

  * [Automatic MySpace Media Remover][16]
  * [MySpace Go Right Home][17]
  * [Myspace custom style remover][18]
  * [phpBB Quick Reply][19]
  * [Google about.com remover][20]
  * [Salon Premium Pass][21]
  * [Gmail: Random Signature][22]
  * [Flickr &#8211; People in this photo][23]
  * [Flickr Camera Images][24]
  * [Flickr AllSizes+][25]

What else do you guys find important? What other tools are great finds? (This is for my Windows laptop, so OS X stuff is not really on-topic, but I wouldn&#8217;t mind hearing what you had to say in that arena as well)
