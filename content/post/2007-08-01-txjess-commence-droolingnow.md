> Another much-loved showrunner (particularly around these parts), Joss Whedon, has a little bit of interesting news too. Seems that all you “Buffy” fans can saddle up and get your excitement on because Whedon is getting ready to make a 90-minute TV movie with the BBC. That movie will be called “Ripper” and will focus on Anthony Stewart Head’s character Giles in his pre-“Buffy” days. No word on when production will begin, but with Whedon and Head already signed up, I expect it’ll be sooner rather than later.

I&#8217;ve heard buzzes and whispers about &#8220;Ripper&#8221; before, but this seems to be a little more than just wishful thinking.
