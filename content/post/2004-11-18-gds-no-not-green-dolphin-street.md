So about a week ago, I installed the [**Google Desktop Search**][1] on my Windows laptop. It was more just to check it out, and see what it did &#8211; I didn&#8217;t really feel a large need to search files on the laptop itself (now, if I could search files on my mapped drives, that would be pretty useful).

But since trying it out, I think it&#8217;s a pretty nifty piece of software. Some of the features are not very useful to me &#8211; the mail searching doesn&#8217;t help, because it only searches Outlook and Outlook Express (my mail at work is Notes) and the browser history searching only searches IE right now, and not Firefox &#8211; although I use IE for intranet browsing, so I can search stuff from work-related sessions, which is useful.

Where it&#8217;s really shone for me is the ability to search AIM conversations. It&#8217;s always driven me nuts that I can log YIM chats, and can log in iChat&#8230;but the Windows version of AIM doesn&#8217;t seem to have the ability to archive chat sessions automatically.

Well, not anymore. The Google Desktop Search apparently intercepts all of the AIM chats I have on this machine, and puts them into its search cache. So for example, I can go to Google, switch to &#8220;Desktop&#8221;, and search for &#8220;Fram&#8221; &#8211; and find all the chats with people I&#8217;ve had about going to Frim Fram. Neat stuff.

If you run Windows, I recommend giving this tool a try. It&#8217;s pretty neat.

Anyone else have any thoughts?

<font color="#ccccff">yes, I read the brouhaha on /. a while ago about how you can theoretically search the files of other users on the same computer if you&#8217;re an admin, blah blah blah&#8230;well, nobody gets to use my computer but me, so I don&#8217;t much care.</font>
