Went to [Improv Olympic][1] tonight with Tracy, her sister, and Chris.

Saw a team called &#8220;Local 914&#8221; as well as the always-fun &#8220;Baby Wants Candy&#8221;.

Local 914 was pretty decent. I was a little confused about their Harold; it seemed somewhat disjointed. And definitely too much stress on being funny. But there were some great moments.

I&#8217;ve seen BWC much better than tonight (they did an improv musical based upon the suggested title of &#8220;Where&#8217;s Your God Now?&#8221;), and it definitely had some great moments. There was one scene where a guy&#8217;s mom is in the hospital, dying of cancer, and she explains to her son that they have colored her blue wherever the cancer is in her body. The doctor says, &#8220;yes, we don&#8217;t usually do that, but it&#8217;s &#8216;Take Your Daughter To Work Day&#8217;.&#8221; It was damn funny.

I think Chris is totally hooked on IO now. He wants to take classes with Tracy and me in September.
