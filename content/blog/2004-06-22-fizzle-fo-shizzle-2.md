Last night was pretty fun at the Fizzle.

Went into my first jam circle (birthday jams don&#8217;t count). Lippy spun &#8220;Sing Sing Sing&#8221;, and an old-school neo-swing jam busted out. I went into it with Backstreet, and we actually did a fairly decent job of it. Too fun.

Got into a debate with Backstreet about approaching women. There was a girl there who we just met that night, who was somewhat cute and somewhat interesting&#8230;he told me I should ask her out. I maintained that doing so would play into the &#8220;creepy swing dancer dork&#8221; thing (considering we didn&#8217;t talk all that much, etc). Not quite sure which of us was right.
