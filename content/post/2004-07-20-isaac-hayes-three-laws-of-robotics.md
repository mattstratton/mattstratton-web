 <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/4182199342254177/" target="_blank">Isaac Hayes&#8217; Three Laws of Robotics</a>:

1. A robot must risk his neck for his brother man, and may not cop out when there&#8217;s danger all about.
     
2. A robot must be a sex machine to all the chicks, except where such actions conflict with the will of his main woman.
     
3. A robot must at all times strive to be one bad motha-shutchyomouth.
