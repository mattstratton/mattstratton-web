I discussed this with yesterday.

I&#8217;m really starting to feel an online disconnect. Which isn&#8217;t a bad thing.

I work pretty hard during the day, which I&#8217;m enjoying. So I get home, and I&#8217;m tired, and I really don&#8217;t feel like spending time on the computer. I give LJ a quick read, say hi to anyone who&#8217;s online, and that&#8217;s it.

Contrast that with the past few years of being on IM and such during the day, and it&#8217;s a new feeling.

That is all.
