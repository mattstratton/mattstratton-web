I tried to post a reply to Sarah&#8217;s question, but she only allows Friends to post, so if someone on her buddy list would pass this along&#8230;

> In the parlance of computer-doodles, a &#8220;bus&#8221; is basically a subsystem used for transporting data between devices inside your computer. For example, the local bus inside your computer is what connects the memory, processor, etc, to the motherboard. The SCSI or IDE bus connects your hard drive(s) to each other, etc.

> Do you really need to care about the speed of your bus? Not really.

It&#8217;s a reply to [this post][1].
