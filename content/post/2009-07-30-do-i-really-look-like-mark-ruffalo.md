In April of this year, my pal <a href="http://twitter.com/daethian" target="_blank">@Daethian</a> on Twitter introduced me to the wonderful snarkfest that is <a href="http://iwillfuckingtearyouapart.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Ask And Ye Shall Receive</a>.  Described as a &#8220;self-imposed quixotic quest to improve the quality of the blogosphere,&#8221; the folks at AAYSR make it their mission to evaluate (at the blogger&#8217;s request only) various blogs and provide constructive (and often hilariously biting) criticism.

I could not resist.

I had to offer myself up for review by the self-described &#8220;most benevolent dominatrixes you have ever encountered, with really great boots.&#8221;

<a href="http://iwillfuckingtearyouapart.blogspot.com/2009/07/eternal-sunshine-of-nerdy-mind.html" target="_blank">Today was my Judgement Day.</a>

All in all, I think I got off pretty safely. Sure, I got slapped on the wrist for my blog&#8217;s design (although the critique reflected the &#8220;old&#8221; look, and as the review notes, I changed it yesterday, right before the AAYSR critique went live), reviewer <a href="http://iwillfuckingtearyouapart.blogspot.com/search/label/Miss%20Missives" target="_blank">Miss Missives</a> did comment that my Tech Tips &#8220;are well-written and understandable even to the relative technophobe.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s a good thing.

The majority of the critique focuses on the desirability of nerds as potential mates, references to my wife as a &#8220;hottie patottie&#8221;, and my resemblance to actor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0749263/" target="_blank">Mark Ruffalo</a>.

What I&#8217;ve found even more fun than the review (which I loved, and I&#8217;m so pleased that I was featured) are the <a href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28050624&postID=8481642840423067181" target="_blank">comments posted</a>. I&#8217;m pretty sure one of them (&#8220;One of the biggest weirdos in my school, total nerd, is a professional photographer in Chicago&#8221;) refers to <a href="http://rentauskas.com/" target="_blank">Lippy</a>, and I do love a rant about Tina Fey wannabes. Good times. Good times indeed.
