So yeah, it&#8217;s been quite a while since I&#8217;ve posted anything of content. Things are moving apace in our lives&#8230;we spent a few days over the holiday Up North, which was a lot of fun. I&#8217;ll get some pictures posted to Flickr one of these days.

Mostly I&#8217;ve just been focused on work (which has been a LOT) and our house searching. We are now narrowed down to two possible homes (although our realtor keeps finding new possibilities). The contenders are as follows:

The East House<img height="113" alt="" width="150" align="right" border="0" src="https://pics.livejournal.com/mattstratton/pic/0001a1az/s320x240" />  
This is a 4 bedroom, 2.5 bath house in Winfield. It&#8217;s got a great finished basement, and the rooms are a good size. The master bath is great &#8211; double sink, soaking tub, and nice shower. Yard backs up to the forest preserve, and has a deck which will need some work. There&#8217;s also an above-ground pool in the backyard that we would want removed. It is just a little over a mile to the train station, and about 30 minutes drive for Carrie to work (in bad traffic). It&#8217;s pretty close to Carrie&#8217;s parents, and not very far from my folks.

<span style="font-style:italic;">What&#8217;s holding us back</span> &#8211; Location. It&#8217;s further west than we&#8217;d like to be, and the neighborhood is kind of &#8220;eh&#8221;. The kitchen would need updating, and it&#8217;s not that big (but it has some possibilities). Needs some minor updates

[<span style="font-weight:bold;">The Pinebrook House</span>][1]<img height="100" alt="" width="150" align="right" border="0" src="https://pics.livejournal.com/mattstratton/pic/0001ba8p/s320x240" />  
This is a 3 bedroom (more on that later), 1.5 bath house in Lombard. It&#8217;s in a psuedo-cul-de-sac with a large (but somewhat oddly shaped) backyard with a GIANT deck. It&#8217;s the epitome of &#8220;move-in ready&#8221;; lots of nice little upgrades. The basement is completely finished in a family room/playroom setup, with an additional bedroom (bringing the total to four), laundry area, and office. It&#8217;s a Lombard address but has Glen Ellyn schools. It&#8217;s a few miles from my parents, and not that far from Carrie&#8217;s folks.

<span style="font-style:italic;">What&#8217;s holding us back </span>&#8211; 1.5 bathrooms and possibly the kitchen (it&#8217;s on the smaller side). This house is also listed a little higher than East.

So we have a lot of thinking to do. The East house is vacant and has been on the market for a long time, so we feel like we could get it for a good deal. The Pinebrook house has had a few price drops, but the owners still live there, so we don&#8217;t know how motivated they are &#8211; but it&#8217;s not necessarily priced out of our range.
