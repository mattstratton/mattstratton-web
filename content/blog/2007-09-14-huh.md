So due to a vagary in the way Flash seems to work with LJ, when people post embedded YouTube stuff, it seems like the &#8220;preview&#8221; picture doesn&#8217;t quite match up &#8211; it takes from the last one it saw, or whatever.

So on this post of Fuzzy talking about his &#8220;sideshow&#8221; act for Impress These Apes&#8230;the video appears to be of Trapper and Mo&#8217;s daughter, Lucy.

I think Hannah is more of the sideshow :)
