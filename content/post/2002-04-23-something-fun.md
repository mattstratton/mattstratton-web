Thanks to for indirectly showing me how to do this&#8230;

[Friendsies][1]

I just like the fact that apparently I consider OSX to be a friend. We&#8217;re not really friends yet&#8230;but one day soon we shall become much closer. Right now OSX is really something that I&#8217;m enamoured with, but we don&#8217;t get along as well as we could.
