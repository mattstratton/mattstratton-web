Apparently, with gmail, putting a period (dot) in the username is meaningless.

For example, my username is &#8220;matt.stratton&#8221;. However, mail addressed to &#8220;mattstratton&#8221; gets to me as well.

This is helpful to know. Because amongst almost all of my friends, the convention of &#8220;[firstnamelastname [at] gmail [dot] com][1]{.linkification-ext}&#8221; has been adopted. But some use the dot, and others don&#8217;t.

This means I don&#8217;t have to remember who does what.

w00t.
