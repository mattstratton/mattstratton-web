Went to Costco last night and got a new Pullman. It is pretty dope. I will be breaking it in this weekend. Finally replacing my old suitcase (which I&#8217;ve had for about 20 years) and the Ginormous Garment Bag From Hell.

Had a loverly dinner at **Carmichael&#8217;s**. I had forgotten about that place. A fantastic Chicago steakhouse. Although the world-famous Brussel sprouts are no longer on the menu (for those of you who don&#8217;t know&#8230;they used to have Brussel sprouts in a bacon and cream sauce. As Sherman put it, &#8220;anything in a bacon sauce will taste good.&#8221;)

I was supposed to go to Fizz with , but after consuming a 20 oz ribeye, all I wanted to do was lay down and digest. So I went home, watched Queer As Folk, and luckily, Erika didn&#8217;t want to go to Fizz either. So it all worked out.
