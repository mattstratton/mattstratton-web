OK, for serious, I am quitting smoking.

I got a prescription for Wellbutrin and everything.

Of course, I found out my insurance doesn&#8217;t cover that drug. But it&#8217;s still cheaper than cigarettes.

I started taking it today. According to the directions, I&#8217;m supposed to smoke for a week still &#8211; it takes a week to kick in. According to my pharmacist friend, it actually will work BETTER if I smoke this week instead of just quitting right now.

Nutty.
