Since we&#8217;re light on content today (I&#8217;m sick, leave me alone), to amuse you, dear readers, I&#8217;m providing you with yet another list of amusing search terms used to find my blog. Some of these searches amuse me because I can&#8217;t figure out why they end up landing on my page, but others I find funny just for the concept that someone typed those words in Google.

  * why are breasts hidden (I still never got a really good answer for this one)
  * national unicorn day (No comment. Seriously.)
  * jobs are for losers (It kind of worries me that this query leads to my blog)
  * classic pirate phrases (Yargh. This search term is driving me nuts)
  * ferret olympics 2009 (This is something you need to search for? Multiple times, no less?)
  * how to lock myself out of facebook (The first sign you have a problem is&#8230;)
  * sexy mud show (What a disappointment when this person landed on my Ren Faire mud show post)
  * flying buttresses improv (Um, Jolene? You guys need to work on your SEO, since the top three hits for this term all find MY blog/LJ)
  * bumbleshorts (This frightens me, because I thought that nobody ever put those letters together besides Brian C)

On a serious note, most of the search keywords that lead people to my blog have to do with Facebook security. But that&#8217;s not amusing. So we&#8217;ll pretend it doesn&#8217;t happen.
