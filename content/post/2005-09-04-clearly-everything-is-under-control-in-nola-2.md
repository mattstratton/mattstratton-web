<span class="postbody">Apparently aid is being rejected by the Feds &#8211; Daley&#8217;s <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/hurricane/cst-nws-daley03.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">all pissed off</a> because they refused his offers for aid.</p> 

<p>
  <span style="font-style:italic;">A visibly angry Mayor Daley said the city had offered emergency, medical and technical help to the federal government as early as Sunday to assist people in the areas stricken by Hurricane Katrina, but as of Friday, the only things the feds said they wanted was a single tank truck.</span><br /> &#8230;<br /> <span style="font-style:italic;">Daley said the city offered 36 members of the firefighters&#8217; technical rescue teams, eight emergency medical technicians, search-and-rescue equipment, more than 100 police officers as well as police vehicles and two boats, 29 clinical and 117 non-clinical health workers, a mobile clinic and eight trained personnel, 140 Streets and Sanitation workers and 29 trucks, plus other supplies. City personnel are willing to operate self-sufficiently and would not depend on local authorities for food, water, shelter and other supplies, he said.</span> </span>
