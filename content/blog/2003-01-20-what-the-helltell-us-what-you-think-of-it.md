_I posted this in a couple of the filmmaker communities&#8230;might as well share it with my friends list&#8230;_

I&#8217;ve uploaded the picture locked version of our latest short subject, _Inventing: Music_.

You can view it here. It&#8217;s a 10 MB QuickTime movie.

We&#8217;re picture-locked on it&#8230;audio still needs some sweetening, and the soundtrack hasn&#8217;t been added yet. Plus the credits aren&#8217;t quite tweaked. But any feedback would be appreciated&#8230;even if you hate it. Either reply to this post or [email me][1].
