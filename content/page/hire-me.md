Hi, I’m **Matty Stratton**—a seasoned leader in Developer Relations with a proven track record of building thriving developer communities, scaling advocacy teams, and driving measurable business growth. Whether you’re looking for a developer advocate to represent your company’s voice or a leader to guide and grow your DevRel organization, I’m here to help take your developer experience to the next level.

## Why Hire Me?

I bring over [15 years of hands-on experience](/Matty-Stratton-CV-2025.pdf) in Developer Relations, community building, and leadership. Here’s what I can offer to your organization:

### Strategic Leadership in Developer Relations

As a leader, I excel at:

- Building and scaling global Developer Relations teams with clear, outcome-focused strategies.
- Aligning developer advocacy efforts with business goals to drive user acquisition, retention, and revenue growth.
- Establishing metrics frameworks that connect DevRel activities to measurable business outcomes.

Examples of my impact:

- At **Aiven**, I led a global team to achieve record-breaking engagement through workshops, meetups, and influencer marketing.
- At **Pulumi**, I transformed the community engagement approach, implementing data-driven metrics and championing user advocacy through the "Puluminaries" program.
- At **PagerDuty**, I transformed Developer Advocacy from a one-person evangelism effort into an operationalized team influencing revenue and pipeline growth.

### Building Thriving Developer Communities

I’m passionate about creating communities where developers feel empowered, engaged, and connected. I’ve launched and grown global programs like:

- The Open Source Data Infrastructure Meetup Network at Aiven, spanning 16 countries with 7,000+ members.
- The “Puluminaries” Community Champion Program at Pulumi, fostering advocacy and user recognition.

I understand how to connect with developers authentically, inspire them to become advocates, and build long-term relationships that benefit both the community and the business.

Some highlights include:

- Speaking at conferences worldwide on DevOps, Infrastructure as Code, and Cloud Engineering.
- Open-sourcing Ops Guides at PagerDuty to share best practices for Incident Response and Operational Reviews.
- Developing and managing the popular **PagerDuty Breakathon**, combining technical challenges with a sense of fun and collaboration.
