&#8230;wake up in the late afternoon. Call Parnell&#8230;

Sorry. Got off on a bit of a tangent there.

Carrie and I had a pretty good Easter. We started off by taking Scout to the park to run off some of his energy. Then, it was off to Old St. Pat&#8217;s for the 11:15 Mass. Carrie was lecturing in the &#8220;hall&#8221;, which basically meant &#8220;the basement&#8221;. Still, it was a good service, and, as always, interesting.

After Mass, we jumped on the Eisenhower to head out to Homestead Flechter for Easter dinner. Despite my spillage of red wine on the tablecloth (totally Carrie&#8217;s fault), everything went smoothly. Scout was a royal pain in the ass, but I guess he&#8217;s just trying to make the most of his last few weeks of puppyhood.
