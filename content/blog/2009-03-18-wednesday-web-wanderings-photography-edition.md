It&#8217;s no secret that I am very interested in photography. And the tubes of the webbernets are chock-full of great online resources to help us i our quest for better pictures and images. This week, in the Web Wanderings, we&#8217;ll focus (ha!) on links that offer insight into such improvements.

**<a href="https://strobist.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Strobist: Learn How To Light</a>** &#8211; Might was well start with the heavy hitter. Think you know about how light works? Consider yourself an expert in flash photography because you&#8217;ve mastered the &#8220;red eye reduction&#8221; button? Ha. The folks at Strobist will demonstrate to you how very little we know&#8230;but make us feel smarter after we&#8217;re done. An essential resource for anyone interested in flash photography.

**<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/4-easy-photoshop-techniques-to-make-your-pictures-pop" target="_blank">4 Easy Photoshop Techniques to Make Your Pictures Pop!</a>** &#8211; Digital Photography School provides a few step-by-step, simple Photoshop tricks to bring out the best in some of your photos. All four of them are super easy to do, and, while they won&#8217;t work in every scenario, I recommend adding them to your stable of post-processing tricks for those times you need a little extra &#8220;oomph&#8221; for an image.

**<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/11-tips-for-better-candid-photography" target="_blank">11 Tips for Better Candid Photography</a>** &#8211; Posed pictures are SO lame&#8230;unless you&#8217;re doing portraiture, of course. But for those times that you&#8217;re NOT shooting in a studio, you want to capture that &#8220;photojournalism&#8221; feel that is ever so popular these days. This list, provided by DPS, has some great ideas that will really improve your candids. Seriously.

**<a href="https://photojojo.com/content/photo-projects/how-to-shoot-street-portraits/" target="_blank">How to Shoot Impromptu Street Portraits</a>** &#8211; I swear I am going to try this one day. It&#8217;s such a brilliant idea, and this post by Photojojo walks you through it with ease and panache.

**<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/self-portrait-photography-tips" target="_blank">Self Portrait Photography Tips</a>** &#8211; I have gotten to the point that I am reading this post almost daily, just to cement it in my mind. Really great insight into how to pull off awesome and intersting self-portraiture.

And we&#8217;ll wrap it up with links to some of my favorite fellow photogs and their work:
