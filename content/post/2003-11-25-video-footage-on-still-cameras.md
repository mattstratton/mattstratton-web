So I see so many still digital cameras that do short bits of video.

My question is&#8230;anyone out there actually using this &#8220;feature&#8221;? My Canon still had the ability to do so, and I never used it. Maybe because I have \*real\* videocameras. But I&#8217;m curious as to what exactly one thinks they can accomplish with this &#8220;feature&#8221;?

Any real-world experience with this, kids?
