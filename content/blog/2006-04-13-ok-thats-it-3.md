Carrie is no longer allowed to go to Cubs games with me.

Today was our third game together. The Cubs got shelled.

Our second game together was an embarassing outing vs. the Astros in 2004 featuring Corey &#8220;I Got Drunk Last Night So I Can&#8217;t Make Plays&#8221; Patterson.

And our first game together (actually, our first date) was Game 7 of the NLCS 2003. And we all know how that ended.

She&#8217;s banned from Wrigley from now on. 

The rest of the pictures from today can be seen [here][1].
