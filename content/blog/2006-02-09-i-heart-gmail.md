Yet another nail has been put in the &#8220;Mugsy using AIM and YIM&#8221; coffin.

Since **[GTalk is now integrated into the gmail website][1]**&#8230;and all the Gtalk conversations are archived into my Gmail&#8230;I will predict that by the end of 2006 I will finally take a hardline stance and refuse to use AIM or YIM anymore. All youse bitches who wanna IM with me will have to ride the Gmail train.
