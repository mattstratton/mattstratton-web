So I sent Jaymie an email yesterday, as a last ditch effort at destroying my dignity.

Got this email from her today:

_HEY &#8211; sorry I haven&#8217;t called you &#8211; I can&#8217;t use my phone &#8216;cuz I&#8217;m waiting for a check to clear. My funds are insufficient. I think it&#8217;s time to get a landline&#8230;.or a better phone plan&#8230;.or maybe even a job. The man is sticking it to me. I hate the man. I&#8217;ve gotta work this weekend but whatcha doin&#8217; Sunday?
  
&#8230;if you offended me&#8230;.heeheehee, that&#8217;s funny. Takes alot to offend me._
