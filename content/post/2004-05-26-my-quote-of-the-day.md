From a conversation I had with <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="http://shanabanana.livejournal.com/"><strong>shanabanana</strong></a></span>::

&#8220;Anyone who drops my name most assuredly does NOT know me.&#8221;

Feel free to use it as much as you&#8217;d like. i think it&#8217;s the best thing I&#8217;ve ever said. Ever.
