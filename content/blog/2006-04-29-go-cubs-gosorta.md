So today I had the best seats at Wrigley I&#8217;ve ever had (if you don&#8217;t count sitting in the press box for post-season games, that is). Chris and I were third row, right off of home plate.

And the Cubs lost, 16-2, to the Milwaukee Brewers.

And it rained.

But it was still awesome. And much better than pretty much anything else ever.
