Well, I was supposed to get the cable modem installed today.

Didn&#8217;t happen.

Here&#8217;s the story:

We have RCN for cable. RCN sucks. At least, their customer service sucks. So we didn&#8217;t want to add additional RCN services. So we were gonna get the cable modem from AT&T, and eventually switch to AT&T cable. AT&T said this was no problem.

So the installer guy comes out today, and says &#8220;oh, I&#8217;m gonna need permission from your landlord to run a cable for AT&T in here.&#8221; Of course, after much deliberation, it is determined that if we got AT&T cable as well, he wouldn&#8217;t have to do anything special.

So he tells me he&#8217;ll come back on Monday, and I should call AT&T and make the cable order. I check with the roommates; they are on-board with switching to AT&T. I call in, and they tell me the earliest that they can get someone out is Thursday. Even though the guy said he&#8217;d come back on Monday. Argh.

So we&#8217;ll see what happens.
