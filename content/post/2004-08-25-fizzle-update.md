On Shana&#8217;s advice, I called the Fizz girl (she needs a nickname &#8211; she&#8217;s a high school math teacher, and I&#8217;m 99% sure she&#8217;s Jewish&#8230;suggestions?)

Mugsy: well yeah, the phone number thing is totally a clue I think
  
Mugsy: I said here, write down your email address so I can send you the evite for tom&#8217;s party
  
Mugsy: and she wrote down her number and email
  
Mugsy: and then took it back and wrote &#8220;rachel&#8221; on it
  
Shana: call her
  
Shana: right now

Anyway, I got the ol&#8217; voice mail, and left a Shana-approved message, as follows:

&#8220;hi rachel, this is matt&#8230;from fizz&#8230;it&#8217;s about 6:30 on wed&#8230;just calling to say hi and see what you are up to tomorrow night. If you would like, you can call me back at 773-220-5940. Have a good night!&#8221;

I don&#8217;t really know why I&#8217;m sharing this with you. I guess I&#8217;ve lost my LJ interesting-o-meter skills from not having access at work.

Anyway, now you know the updates. I&#8217;m sure you feel like a better person for this information.

I use my icon of &#8220;teh lohan&#8221; because I know it&#8217;s the only way to get and to read my entries.
