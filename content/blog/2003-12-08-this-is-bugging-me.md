OK, so last night&#8217;s Simpsons episode was &#8220;Today I Am A Clown.&#8221;

It was better than the Simpsons has been lately, but I was bugged by one thing.

The basic plot was that Krusty could not get a star on the &#8220;Jewish Walk of Fame&#8221; because he&#8217;d never had a bar mitzvah, and was therefore &#8220;not Jewish.&#8221;

Bullshit.

You actually don&#8217;t &#8220;have&#8221; a bar mitzvah&#8230;you are made bar mitzvah (&#8220;bar mitzvah&#8221; basically means &#8220;adult Jewish man&#8221;). And you don&#8217;t need a ceremony for it to happen. All you have to do is turn 13. Poof. You&#8217;re now bar mitzvah.

That is all.
