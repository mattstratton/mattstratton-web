On &#8216;s advice, on Friday afternoon I emailed [that girl from Thursday night][1].

It was nice and breezy:

_Hey, I hope you had a good time last night. I&#8217;m sorry I was a wet
  
blanket at the end, but I started to crash hard. I guess I can&#8217;t party
  
like the rockstar that you are._

No reply. So I guess Larry and Livia were probably right :)
