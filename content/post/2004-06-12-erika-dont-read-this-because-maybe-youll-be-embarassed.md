I saw last night perform in _Rigoletto_ as Gilda.

Damn, she&#8217;s awesome. She has this super powerful voice that is just amazing to hear come out of someone who&#8217;s just like&#8230;normal. If that makes sense. Plus I was really impressed with her acting &#8211; the only acting I&#8217;ve seen her do was show off her ass in _Dancing with Gaia_ or be a snooty waitress in _Inventing: Music_, so it was pretty cool to see her play a character with some strong emotion. Yay Erika!

I don&#8217;t know for sure, but I keep wanting to think that _Rigoletto_ is the opera in _Godfather Part III_. Even if it&#8217;s not, I think there&#8217;s a heavy _Rigoletto_ theme in that movie.
