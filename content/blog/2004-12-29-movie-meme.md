did this meme, which was invented by , and since I love movies, I thought I&#8217;d do it as well.

Similar to the &#8220;here&#8217;s the lyric, name the song&#8221; meme, you will find below many lines from movies. When you know the answer, reply in a comment. Once someone gets it right, I will cross it out and put the correct movie next to it.

No cheating using the webbernet, because I will be able to tell.

Jervo screened comments in his, to &#8220;prevent cheating&#8221;, but I don&#8217;t quite know what that means.
