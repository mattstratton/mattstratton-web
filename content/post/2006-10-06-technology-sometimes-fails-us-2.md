I&#8217;ve been messing around with the face recognition features of [Riya][1], and it&#8217;s pretty good. Although as you can see, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t quite hit the mark.

It&#8217;s a neat idea though. I don&#8217;t know how big of a player they&#8217;ll turn out to be, since Google ended up going with someone else for their recognition software for Picasa, and now Riya.com is just trying to be an &#8220;also-ran&#8221; in the image search arena. But if they can get a good Flickr integration going, who knows.

Check it out though. It&#8217;s fun to play with.
