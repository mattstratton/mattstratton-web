So I&#8217;m getting there.

Carrie and I are having a race to see who can lose the most weight between now and our Michigan trip (so basically between June 10th and July 7th). It&#8217;s a factor of percentage, not pounds, so I have to lose more pounds than she does (since I&#8217;m bigger). The winner gets a free pass to force the loser to perform an activity they don&#8217;t want to do (take out the garbage, go to a movie they don&#8217;t want to see, etc).
