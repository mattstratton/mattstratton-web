It&#8217;s so freaking inappropriate for me to become emotionally paralzyed WHILE AT WORK over internet crap.

Those of you who are on Yehoodi know what I&#8217;m talking about, and will also need to know that I just can&#8217;t deal with Yehoodi in general anymore. At least not for a while.

Like I have said before, I don&#8217;t usually cry for &#8220;banning&#8221; and such. But A FRIEND OF PEOPLE IN THE SCENE DIED.

This is IMPORTANT.

This is NOT BULLSHIT.

This is NOT THE TIME TO BE A BIG FUCKING PUSSY AND PRETEND THAT YEHOODI EVEN MATTERS.

Everyone makes a bigger thing out of this stupid crap. It&#8217;s the fucking internet On a message board for SWING DANCERS.

This whole thing is so far from relevent. Who cares if you are &#8220;impartial&#8221; &#8211; you&#8217;re not the media, guys. You&#8217;re a mod of a dorkboard.Real life problems, lke friends dying, that&#8217;s important shit.

This really has very little to do with Sublindy herself.

I am waiting to see how our mutual friends react.

I have a lot of friends who are friends with her, who apologize for her constantly &#8211; &#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s so sweet in person, she just lets politics get to her&#8221;.

If they apologize for her this time, friendship over.

Because that condones such a level of inhumanity I can&#8217;t even get near.
