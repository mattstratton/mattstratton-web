Hey guys.

Carrie is looking to get a new job, outside of the teaching profession. One of her father&#8217;s friends has an opening for an Admin Director (basically an executive assistant to four executives with a large financial firm) and has suggested that she apply for it.

Last night we worked on her resume &#8211; but I have little experience with resumes in this arena; mine is all with technical people. If anyone who knows about this kind of thing would be interested/willing in giving it a critique, I&#8217;d appreciate it. We&#8217;re hoping to finish up her cover letter tonight and send both in tomorrow, so if you will have some time to look at it today, please leave a comment here with an email address I could send it to. This is friends-locked, so don&#8217;t worry about spambots finding your email.

Thanks!
