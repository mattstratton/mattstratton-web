Inspired by [Trapper][1], I created a photoset on Flickr to represent my favorite pictures of 2005. I tried to limit it to pictures I had taken (there are pictures in my photostream from 2005 that other people took) or at least, if I didn&#8217;t take the picture, pictures I am in.

Let me know what you think. I have a prediction that my &#8220;Best of 2006&#8221; will be more extensive.
