It seems that about once a week, I get a message like this one:

&#8220;So, I need to learn about this DevOps thing&#8230;where do I start?&#8221;

In the interests of not having to keep sending the same email over and over again, I thought I would create a little blog post where I compile links to my favorite books, podcasts, talks, etc, for easy re-use. I&#8217;ll be adding to this post over time as I come across new stuff.

WARNING &#8211; this post is basically a copypasta of an email I keep sending, and therefore is not comprehensive, and probably a bit more editorialized that it should be. For now, I wanted to get all the links up, and I&#8217;ll deal with the prose later.

## Books

_<a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Phoenix-Project-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592" target="_blank">The Phoenix Project</a>_ &#8211; this is your &#8220;why&#8221; for DevOps, told in the form of a novel. Stop what you are doing, read this, and then come back. We&#8217;ll wait.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912/" target="_blank"><em>Continuous Delivery</em></a> &#8211; in some ways, a definitive work for DevOps. You don&#8217;t have to do CD to do DevOps, but you should read this book anyway.

_<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Enterprise-Adopting-Continuous-Delivery/dp/1449368425" target="_blank">Lean Enterprise: Adopting Continuous Delivery, DevOps, and Lean Startup at Scale</a> _&#8211; another book by Jez Humble, and worth reading if you think DevOps is just for startups (spoiler alert: it&#8217;s not).

## Podcasts

Podcasts are a great way to learn about new stuff, and I love them. This is NOT a comprehensive list of DevOps podcasts, by any means

<a href="https://www.arresteddevops.com" target="_blank">Arrested DevOps</a> &#8211; I co-host this podcast with Trevor Hess, and our intent is to be a &#8220;DevOps 101&#8221; &#8211; introducing concepts and discussions for someone new to DevOps, and then you can &#8220;graduate&#8221; on to the harder stuff listed below.

<a href="https://devopscafe.org/" target="_blank">DevOps Cafe</a>  &#8211; these dudes are hardcore and how I started learning about DevOps. Pretty intense and you might want to level up on some other stuff before you listen to them because a lot of it will not make sense without background. I still only understand about half of what John and Damon are talking about.

<a href="https://theshipshow.com/" target="_blank">The Ship Show</a> &#8211; Pretty broad in topic, so you might want to cherry pick through episodes for the DevOps stuff. Paul is a REALLY good interviewer and when they have on good guests I always learn a lot.

## ADO Episodes in particular

These are three episodes of my podcast you should listen to if you don&#8217;t listen to any others.
