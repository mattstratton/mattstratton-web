Went for another ride today by myself. Ten miles, approx (I need to get an odometer for my bike, since guesstimating with the gmaps pedometer isn&#8217;t working that well).

So in the past three days of bike ownership, I&#8217;ve ridden 23 miles. Granted, Trapper and Kevin rode further than that on Sunday morning, but that&#8217;s not the point. The point is, my bike is awesome and my fianc√©e is awesome for letting me buy it :)
