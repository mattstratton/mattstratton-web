So I have a Tivo-quandry.

But first, let me bring you up to speed on my Tivo/DVR history, so you can better understand my situation.

I got my first Tivo in 1999 &#8211; Series 1 with Lifetime service. In 2003 I replaced it with a Series 2.

I loved my Series 2. I used every possible feature it had &#8211; Internet scheduling, streaming pictures and music from my Mac, and even dumping shows from the Tivo to my PC laptop.

A little over a year ago, I got a TV with HD for the first time. Since, at the time, the only HD solution for Tivo was a) only for DirectTV, and b) $999, I decided to switch to Comcast&#8217;s DVR. Two tuners, plus it could record HD. I bid my Series 2 farewell (it found a home as a gift) and decided to try the Comcast route.

I hated it. I still do. But I love watching baseball (and some other shows, mostly on DiscoveryHD) in high definition.

Flash forward to the present. We&#8217;re still using the Comcast DVR. It&#8217;s still a pain in the ass to use. It still freezes up all thel time (this is the second unit I&#8217;ve gotten from them in a year &#8211; they seem to last about six months before freezing up daily).

I want to be done with this. I want to go back to Tivo.

Problem is &#8211; the Series 3 Tivo (which will do everything I want, in theory &#8211; HD recording on multiple tuners) isn&#8217;t supposed to be out until &#8220;second half of 2006&#8221;. Plus, I&#8217;m not sure if Comcast will offer the CableCard stuff that Tivo needs. Plus it will probably cost between $500-$1,000. There&#8217;s also rumors of Comcast moving to Tivo &#8220;software&#8221; this year, but again, it&#8217;s all speculation about the details/timeline.

I am really considering getting one of the new Dual Tuner Series 2 Tivos. Although they kind of suck too &#8211; I won&#8217;t get HD, and I won&#8217;t get &#8220;true&#8221; dual tuner functionality (the second tuner will only record the handful of analog channels I get). But for $19.95/month and $30 upfront for the box, I can have my Tivo again (I could get it cheaper per month for a longer contract, but I don&#8217;t want to lock into this Tivo for more than a year, since hopefully a year from now the Series 3 will be out, stable, and affordable).

What do you all think? Is the DT Series 2 a good stopgap measure for me?
