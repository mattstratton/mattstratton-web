Pretty uneventful weekend.

Friday night I stayed in, continuing my week of hermit-ness. Basically just IM-ed with Erika and we were mac.geeks. Then I went to bed. Yay.

Saturday I went to the post office, and then had dinner at home with Sarah and Chris. They made a ton of pasta and sauce, because a bunch of people were apposed to come over to join us, but nobody did, so we just chowed down. Then we went out with Kevin and sat and played pool. It was really fun. Yay for fun.

Sunday was more editing on [DWG][1]. I think we&#8217;re almost done. Which is good because Superior Street is about to kick us out. We finished the comedy club scene on Sunday, and I am actually finally happy with it. So now all we have to do is drop in the interview footage, titles, color correct a couple scenes, and drop in the soundtrack, and the motherfucker is DONE. Probably gonna be completely done in mid-Feb. Yay.

Had a meeting for the Black and Tan after editing. Then came home, at leftover meatballs, and watched The Osbournes, Jackass, and Insommniac with Sarah. So a typical Sunday night.
