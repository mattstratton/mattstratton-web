This is a picture taken last night of my friend Chris, who was awesome enough to arrange the whole thing at Suite. The bar was super cool, and apparently, difficult to get in if you didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;name&#8221; (when Carrie and I got there, early, it was kind of empty, but Lippy said that there was a big line to get in when he showed up, and he only got through the door by dropping Chris&#8217;s name).

Fun times.

More pictures from the night can be seen [here][1].
