Lippy&#8217;s party was tonight.

It was great. All the hard work paid off and it was fun. No fooling around with chicks, because, as a friend pointed out, they all know me. The one girl who I thought might be someone interesting, well, as usual, my friend who is much more aggressive was putting on the moves. For what it&#8217;s worth. But I don&#8217;t much care.

Costume reveal: I was part of a group costume. I was Doc from _The Love Boat_. Brian was Capt Stubing, Tracy was Julie, her friend Jamie was Vicky, Ryan was Isaac, and Erika was Charo.

We won Best Costume at the party. That&#8217;s because we rule. Photos to come later.

Oh, and [Kim][1] looked hot.
