So I think I&#8217;m going to get rid of my Tivo.

Here&#8217;s the thought process:

Since I got my new TV, I upgraded my cable to support HD. I love HD. It looks so amazingly awesome.

Problem is, Tivo doesn&#8217;t record HD &#8211; unless you get the $999 HDTivo, which only works with DirectTV.

So for only $5/month more than I already pay Comcast, they sent me over a dual-tuner DVR that also records HD. My plan was to keep the Tivo to record the &#8220;non HD&#8221; stuff, and use the Comcast DVR for the rest.

This is turning out to be a bit of a pain in the ass. Plus now I&#8217;m paying almost $20/month for both DVR&#8217;s. Crazy.

As I see it, this is what I am losing by getting rid of the Tivo:

1) Wishlists &#8211; I&#8217;m gonna miss this one. I have many wishlists set up for my favorite directors. The Comcast DVR doesn&#8217;t do this.
  
2) Home Media Option &#8211; this lets me play music from my iTunes through my TV, and view pictures. I think I might just get one of those roku boxes to do that.
  
3) Tivo To Go &#8211; I haven&#8217;t used this to burn any dvd&#8217;s yet, but it&#8217;s been kind of cool to dump tv shows to my laptop to watch on the plane. But not cool enough to justify $13/month.

The other thing that sucks is that I don&#8217;t know the Comcast remote well enough &#8211; I can drive the Tivo &#8220;blind&#8221;, since I know the buttons so well. This will come with time.

The other main advantage of choosing the Comcast solution over Tivo (besides HD) is the On Demand thing. I really like that.

I&#8217;m still considering&#8230;but man, it feels weird to even think about.
