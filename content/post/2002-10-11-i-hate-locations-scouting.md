I wish I had a production designer.

[GTF][1] is doing a short subject entitled &#8220;Inventing: Music&#8221;. And since it&#8217;s a short, and microbudget, we have a really small crew. Basically, it&#8217;s the DP, sound guy, and me. I&#8217;m having to wear a lot of hats &#8211; officially I&#8217;m just the director, but I&#8217;m ending up doing producer work, plus production design.

And I hate scouting locations. But I really can&#8217;t justify calling in a favor to get a production designer for this short.

Argh.
