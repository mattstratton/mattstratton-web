[Gravy Train Films][1] has begun production on their newest short film, _Inventing: Stephen_.

The film is a short subject focussing on how we attempt to &#8220;re-invent&#8221; ourselves to move on.

_Inventing: Stephen_ was written by [Matt Stratton][2] and [Dallas Trinkle][3]. The film is produced by [Matt Stratton][4] and will be directed by [Dallas Trinkle][5].

Production crew will consist of GTF veterans Dave &#8220;Lippy&#8221; Rentauskas (Director of Photography), Tracy Hogan (Assistant Director), and Jason Balutan (Art Director). Ryan Peterson will be making his crew debut as the Production Sound Mixer.

_Inventing: Stephen_ will feature many familiar faces in the GTF filmography, including Kelly Belmont (_[Dancing With Gaia][6]_, _Inventing: Music_), Kristin Collins (_[Dancing With Gaia][6]_, _Inventing: Music_), Jackson Weber (_[Dancing With Gaia][6]_), David Lawrence (_[Dancing With Gaia][6]_), and Chris Rebacz (_[Dancing With Gaia][6]_).
