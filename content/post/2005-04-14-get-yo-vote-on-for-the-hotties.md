So a friend of mine knows this chick who is, like hot and stuff, and she&#8217;s a finalist for some Maxim competition.

Here&#8217;s what he said about it. Read it and do as he says, or else soapy frogs will come out of your nether regions.

OK, so T. is officially up on the Maxim Hometown Hotties page this week.</p> 

In order to move up to the semi-finals, she needs lots of votes from different people. So if you have a moment, could you all hit the following link and vote for T. &#8211; **http://www.maximonline.com/hotties/voting/**

T. is Tera from Linden.

Unfortunately (or fortunately if you like this kind of stuff,) you&#8217;ll have to also vote for 9 other women in order for your vote to go thru. Perhaps you can pick 9 random people? You&#8217;re only supposed to vote once, but since they don&#8217;t take your e-mail address &#8211; you can probably vote multiple times if you go on different computers or different accounts?!? I don&#8217;t know since I&#8217;m not super technical.

Also for those who use the computer at work &#8211; the sight is somewhat worksafe, if you consider girls in bikinis and sexy poses worksafe. There&#8217;s no nudity there.

T. thanks you, and so do I.</i>
