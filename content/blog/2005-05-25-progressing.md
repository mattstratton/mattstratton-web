Spent most of the day emailing with CC (that&#8217;s the official nickname for the Craigslist girl, until we think of a better one). At the last minute this afternoon, I got tickets to tonight&#8217;s Cubs game, and invited her, but she&#8217;s got plans. But she \*did\* want to go.

Man, I hope we get along in person. We had some good emails. We have a lot in common, personality-wise, and she seems really sweet.

I met up on Friday night with another Craigslist girl &#8211; she was nice, and plenty cute, but I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s potential. She&#8217;s a little too &#8230; wild for me? She&#8217;s a violin teacher, which is cool, but she&#8217;s still got a little too much rock and roll lifestyle to mesh well with the Mugs.
