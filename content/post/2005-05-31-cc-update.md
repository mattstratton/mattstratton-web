Long phone conversation tonight. We&#8217;re having our first date on Thursday; we&#8217;ll be having an early evening picnic up at Recreation Drive by the lakeshore.

So far so good. Thursday will be telling. Also, I keep forgetting that she&#8217;s 5&#8217;10&#8221; (same height as me). Hopefully that won&#8217;t wig me out when we meet in person.
