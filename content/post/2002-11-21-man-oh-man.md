&#8230;do I miss [TechTV][1].

But in my jonesing, I found all sorts of neat stuff online, including [Cat&#8217;s Blog][2].

Sadly, she doesn&#8217;t seem to update it much. seems to be more active on hers. And Leo seems to have some interesting stuff on occassion.

I think I need a Cat Schwartz [coffee mug][3].
