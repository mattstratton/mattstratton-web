So the digitizing of the <a href="https://www.dancingwithgaia.com" title="DWG" target="_blank"><em>Dancing With Gaia</em></a> master tape went off without a hitch, thanks to the fine folks at <a href="https://www.videoreplaychicago.com/" title="Video Replay" target="_blank">Video Replay</a>.

I am currently burning the capture clips off to DVD&#8217;s for archive purposes. Dallas will be here next weekend so we can author the DVD and ship it off for replication, after which everyone who worked on the film will be getting their copy (well, everyone who is owed a copy; extras don&#8217;t get &#8220;paid&#8221;).

Still not sure when copies will be available for the general public. There are weird things with festival submissions and having the film available to the public before, yada yada yada.

And yes, Marcelo, I&#8217;m going to keep referring to it as a _film_. And you can bite my shiny metal ass.
