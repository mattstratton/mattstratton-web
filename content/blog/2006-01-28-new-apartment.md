We got the apartment we wanted!

It was amazing. Carrie found this place on Craigslist a few days ago&#8230;I told her not to get her hopes up, since we weren&#8217;t going to be moving until April 1st, so I was sure it would not be available for then.

But she emailed the guy, and he said he could do a March 1st move in. We went to see it this morning. It is perfect. It has a backyard, a garage, all new fixtures and appliances, new windows&#8230;free washer/dryer in the basement&#8230;two bedrooms and a den (which will be my office) and central air/heat. And they allow dogs.

Well, we filled out an application, and the owner checked with his wife (they&#8217;re both teachers, which probably helped us, since Carrie is one too), and he just called to say &#8220;hey, come sign the lease tomorrow for a March 15th move-in date.&#8221;

So exciting.

Here&#8217;s what was on Craigslist:

Lincoln Square/North Center
  
2 bedroom 1 bath plus den on 2nd floor of recently rehabbed brick two flat.
  
New kitchen w/dishwasher, microwave and garbage disposal, wood floors, central air/heat, free laundry, front deck, back yard and lots of storage. Walking distance to Western Ave Brown line (open during construction), Jewel, shops, entertainment and dining, Old Town School of Folk Music, Sulzer Library and Welles Park which has tennis courts and indoor swimming pool. Dogs and Cats OK.
