It is 6:40 in the AM.

I have been at work for an hour by now.

However, I just realized I can look out my window and watch the sunrise over Navy Pier. That&#8217;s pretty bomb-ass.

I&#8217;ll update later with the fun of this weekend. Or the craptacularness of it. You&#8217;ll just have to wait and find out!
