I haven&#8217;t posted in my LJ since last Monday. That&#8217;s lazy.

I feel like a lot has happened. But I don&#8217;t know if I have the energy to post about it all.

Some things that I \*should\* write about, but haven&#8217;t:

  * Carrie and I went down to Champaign this weekend with my mom and my sister to visit and my other sister, Debbie. Along the way we had lunch with . 
      * Lou Piniella will be the new manager of the Chicago Cubs. I am less than thrilled with this. 
          * I am sick. 
              * The Chicago Bears pulled out a crazy win last night. They did it all after I turned off the game. 
                  * I still haven&#8217;t watched Friday&#8217;s episode of Battlestar Galactica.</ul> 
                    The rest of the Cham-bana pictures can be seen [here][1].
