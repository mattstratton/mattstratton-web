So I realized today&#8230;there are like NO good pictures of me.

Actually, that&#8217;s not true. There probably are. But I don&#8217;t like them. As I told Trish last night&#8230;I&#8217;m very vain and think I look fat in just about every picture. Except for the one that is my default icon right now. But other than that, it&#8217;s not a good picture.

I&#8217;ve taken lots of neat <a href="https://photography.mattstratton.com" target="_blank">neat pictures</a> of others&#8230;I don&#8217;t know why I can&#8217;t do self-portraits.

Just some ramblings. Because I&#8217;d like to have some new LJ icons :)
