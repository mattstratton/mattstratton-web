(Carrie and I have decided that our Christmas present to each other is going to be a bark collar for our dog, Scout (a 2 1/2 year old Sheltie).

We&#8217;ve tried loads of different behavior tricks. I tried a friend&#8217;s suggestion of calling him into the kitchen and giving him a treat when he barks, but the problem is, once he starts barking, he goes so crazy he doesn&#8217;t pay any attention.

I tried the water bottle, but all that happens when I squirt him with water is he barks louder and runs away.

So we&#8217;re ready to try the collar. I want CONCRETE recommendations from dog owners who have used them. I want model and type recommendations and information on HOW you used them successfully. Posts of the following type will be ignored (and mocked offline):

&#8220;Shocking your dog is mean. I love animals. Also, I am a hippie.&#8221;
  
&#8220;My uncle used one of those collars once. I think he had a dog.&#8221;
  
&#8220;You should watch _The Dog Whisperer_.&#8221;

Thanks!
