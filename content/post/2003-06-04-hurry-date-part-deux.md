So Kitty talked me into it&#8230;I&#8217;ll be doing Hurry Date tonight.

I&#8217;m a little unsure. I don&#8217;t know that I make a good first impression. To paraphrase Chandler, Mugsy&#8217;s funny, sophisticated, and he&#8217;s very loveable, _once you get to know him._

I&#8217;ll report back tomorrow!
