Just finished up &#8220;studying&#8221; for my bartending test tomorrow.

A bunch of my friends came over, and ordered drinks off of my study cards. I made the drinks, and they drank them. Everyone had fun (I hope). It was interesting to actually pour with real liquor!

And I passed Jayno&#8217;s Long Island Iced Tea test. This made me happy.
