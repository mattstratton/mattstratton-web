So, I&#8217;m working from home today. I&#8217;m on a conference call. When I work from home, I turn on my laptop&#8217;s speakers, and have a fairly loud sound attached to new Sametime* messages. However, I neglected to turn the volume down before getting on a conference call. About ten minutes into the call, my boss sends me a Sametime message.&nbsp;Because I use a headset, the entire call was treated to a sudden,&nbsp;very loud interruption of George Costanza shouting &#8220;I&nbsp;PROCLAIM THIS THE SUMMER OF GEORGE!&#8221;

I don&#8217;t think they stopped laughing for a good two minutes straight.&nbsp;I&nbsp;was soooo embarassed.&nbsp;
