**WHAT:** A joint photoshoot adventure spearheaded by <a href="http://youllgrowtoloveme.com" target="_blank">Jenn</a> and Matt. Multiple photographers shooting multiple models

**WHEN:** Saturday, March 27th, from noon until approximately 3 PM

**WHERE:** Location is TBD, but likely somewhere near downtown Chicago with great outdoor space for a shoot

**WHO:** Maximum of four shooters and four subjects.

**WHY:** <a href="http://twitter.com/jenniferalaine" target="_blank">@jenniferalaine</a> and I already were planning to do an outdoor photo shoot when she&#8217;s back in town. But then we thought, why keep all the fun to ourselves?

The theory here is we&#8217;ll have a group of photographers and photographees together in one location. The mix of multiple photographers taking pictures of the same people will provide some interesting results, as each photographer is going to have his own take on the subject. For the folks being photographed, it&#8217;ll provide the fun of modeling, plus some new portraits for potential use on personal websites, or profiles, or whatever. For the photographer, this can either just be for funsies, or maybe for portfolio building.

We also will work out the copyright/rights scenario, but my going in position would be for the photographer to retain copyright on all images, but provide a perpetual license to the model for their use of the photos in any way they choose. Ultimately, we want this in a way that both photographer and subject get &#8220;something out of it&#8221;, so to speak.

**HOW:** In theory, this is an &#8220;invite only&#8221; tweetup, and you should only be seeing this webpage if <a href="http://twitter.com/jenniferalaine" target="_blank">@jenniferalaine</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/mattstratton" target="_blank">@mattstratton</a> invited you to participate. We&#8217;d like to keep this limited to folks we know and also keep the group size down to keep it manageable. If you&#8217;re down with this and want to participate, just hit me up using my [Contact form][1] (or DM one of us on Twitter, or email, if you know our email addresses). I&#8217;ll also update this page as we add folks to get an idea of who will be taking part.
