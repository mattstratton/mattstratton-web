So there&#8217;s a problem with my &#8220;My Pictures&#8221; screensaver&#8230;

&#8230;the photos of Amy are in there. And since my Mac&#8217;s screensaver is running all the time, and there are over 100 Amy shots in there, I see a lot of Amy now. And she looks really pretty. And that makes me sad.

But not Strong Sad :)
