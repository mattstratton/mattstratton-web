Just got word that _Inventing: Music_ was accepted into the <a href="http://www.rochesterfilmfest.org/" target="_blank">Rochester International Film Festival</a>, May 6-8.

I&#8217;m excited. I will definitely be going to this! Special thanks to for clueing me into this festival. He&#8217;ll be getting a shout-out in our acceptance speech.

Any of you in the area &#8211; our screening date is the Saturday evening slot at 8 PM. Hope to see you there!
