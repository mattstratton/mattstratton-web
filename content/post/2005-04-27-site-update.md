Been playing around a little, and decided to update [**mattstratton.com**][1].

![][2]

Go check it out. Tell me how awesome it is. Etc, etc.

I have to give credit to , because I ganked some of his CSS styles and some other stuff. Because he&#8217;s way cooler than I am.

Edit: Made this a &#8220;friends only&#8221; post, so that it doesn&#8217;t show up on the feed and make my site waaaay too meta.
