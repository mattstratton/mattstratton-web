I got the _Mean Girls_ DVD last week, but finally got around to watching it today.

It&#8217;s still as funny as I remember from seeing it in the theater. I watched a couple of the &#8220;extras&#8221; &#8211; one thing that was hilarious was a little &#8220;PSA&#8221; with Regina, Rachel, and Karen. It&#8217;s Rachel talking about how hard it is to grow up as a young woman in this world:

Rachel: Even in the United States and England, 7 out of 10 girls have a negative body image.
  
Regina: Who cares? Six of those girls are right.
