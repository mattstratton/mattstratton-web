So it&#8217;s 7 AM on Friday&#8230;I&#8217;ve been at work for 45 minutes (I came in early because I have to leave for the airport at 10 AM&#8230;and I need the hours).

Problem is&#8230;I have nothing to do. I have a couple things to get done this morning, but I can&#8217;t do them until other people get in&#8230;around 9 :)

So I&#8217;m bored. If you&#8217;re on AIM, msg me at MugsyMalone74.
