Carrie, Scout, and I had a great time at [Bark in the Park][1] this morning! We did a 5K walk, starting at Montrose Harbor. Plus, Scout got a LOT of cool loot, including four packages of Pup-Peroni (his favorite).

I also bought him a Cubs hat for an early birthday present (his birthday is on Monday &#8211; he will be one year old). 

More pictures can be found <u>[here][2]</u>.
