Today is one of those days when I just want to blow everything off and stay home watching tv forever.

I have two relatively large organizational challenges this weekend, and both are aggravating me.

First one is the poker tournament tonight. Due to circumstances completely out of his control one of my organizer partners had to bail on a lot of the planning. Please keep in mind that I bear him no ill will about this &#8211; it&#8217;s a sucky situation he&#8217;s in that caused this. Hopefully everything will end up working out today, but I don&#8217;t even know how we&#8217;re going to pull this off if he doesn&#8217;t make it back in town in time. My other partner is busy all day, so it&#8217;s just on me to figure out the 11th hour fallback stuff. It probably wouldn&#8217;t bother me as much if I wasn&#8217;t already so frustrated about&#8230;

&#8230;tomorrow&#8217;s softball game. Another friend of mine and I have been talking every summer for the past three years about doing this. So finally a month or so ago, we decided to finally do it. I&#8217;ve done almost all of the planning for it (which granted hasn&#8217;t been a whole lot). But the kicker was a few days ago he says to me &#8220;Oh, shit, I forgot the game was this weekend and I am going out of town.&#8221;

I&#8217;m irritated because 1) now I have to do \*everything\*, and 2) some of the people coming to the game/cookout are friends of his that I don&#8217;t even know. I know why he&#8217;s going out of town, and I think it&#8217;s cool, but it just bugs me that he freaking FORGOT about an event he allegedly is helping to plan.

I&#8217;m sure it will all work out though.
