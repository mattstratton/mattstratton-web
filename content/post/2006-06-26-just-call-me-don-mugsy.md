Yesterday was the baptism of our niece, Katelyn (do I get to call her my niece yet, or do I have to wait until Carrie and I get married?)

Ellie (Carrie&#8217;s sister) and Kevin asked Carrie and me to be Kate&#8217;s godparents. I&#8217;ve never even been to a baptism before, so it was quite the interesting experience for this Jew. I made a lot of _Godfather_ jokes, but nobody got them.

But it was fun. More pictures [here][1].
