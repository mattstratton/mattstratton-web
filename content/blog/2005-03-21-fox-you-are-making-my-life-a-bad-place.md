So Fox cancels _Arrested Development_*, but what new shows do they replace it with?

_Stacked_ ,which features Pamela Anderson as &#8220;a bookstore employee trying to make a new start in life&#8221; andÂ  _Life on a Stick_, which &#8220;centers on several teen characters who work and hang out at the mall food court.&#8221;

* &#8211; From what I can read, the official line from Fox re: AD is &#8220;they won&#8217;t decide the show&#8217;s future until May, when it announces its fall schedule.&#8221;

Has anyone heard anything more concrete?

Edited to add the additional info I had read, which I read \*before\* Jervo&#8217;s comment below&#8230;I just never hit &#8220;submit&#8221; on the &#8220;edit post&#8221; screen. For serious.
