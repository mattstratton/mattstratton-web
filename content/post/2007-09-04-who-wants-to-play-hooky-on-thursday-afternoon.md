I have two tickets to the Cubs/Dodgers game at Wrigley Field for Thursday 9/6 at 1:20 PM. I was going to go to the game with my boss, but he&#8217;s out of town this week. So if any of my friends are interested in joining me for an afternoon of baseball, let me know. The tickets are $30 each (they&#8217;re upper deck, but pretty much right behind home plate, so should be a good view. And regardless, a bad day of baseball beats a good day working!)
