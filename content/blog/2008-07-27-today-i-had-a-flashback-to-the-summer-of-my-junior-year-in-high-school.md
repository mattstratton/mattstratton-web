Today, Carrie and I went to the [Bristol Renaissance Faire][1] (my first visit since 1992 or thereabouts), and we had a great time. It was a hoot to see shows like the Swordsmen who were there back when I used to go, and find that it&#8217;s just as fantastic and hilarious sixteen years later.

After lunch, we were walking out of a shop and I saw a quiver laying on the ground. I thought &#8220;Hey, that guy is an archer like Doug&#8221;, and then, sure enough, it WAS my friend Doug. We chatted for a while about pickles, and he (justifiably) berated me for not telling anyone we were coming. In our defense, we weren&#8217;t sure until late last night anyway :)

Carrie also tried on a corset. If we weren&#8217;t about to put down a ton of money on a new house, we probably would have bought it. She&#8217;s got the perfect figure for it. We definitely will need costumes next time we go; this was the first time I&#8217;d been and NOT dressed up, and I felt like a friggin&#8217; tourist.
