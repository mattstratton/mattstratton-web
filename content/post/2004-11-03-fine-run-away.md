In all seriousness&#8230;what&#8217;s with this whole &#8220;I am gonna leave the country&#8221; crap.

Cowards. All of you.

First of all &#8211; you concede so easily? I thought liberals were supposed to be the ones willing to fight for civil rights and all that. Or you just want it when it&#8217;s handed to you? Pussies.

Secondly &#8211; if you&#8217;re predicting the gloom and doom and global apocolypse that four more years of GWB and GOP will bring&#8230;do you honestly think that there&#8217;s a corner of this Earth where you&#8217;d be safe? Ask your friends living in other countries &#8211; they were all watching this election as warily as you were. Because yes, it AFFECTED THE ENTIRE PLANET. So running off to Amsterdam so you can get high legally isn&#8217;t going to save you from Georgie Boy&#8217;s WWIII.

Get some perspective. Get some balls. And punch every 18-29 year old you see who didn&#8217;t vote.
