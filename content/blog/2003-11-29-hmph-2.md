Hmm.

Not sure about Carrie these days.

She doesn&#8217;t like _Family Guy_.

She doesn&#8217;t like indie movies.

She doesn&#8217;t like &#8220;things that are meant for kids that they make for adults&#8221; (i.e. _Greg the Bunny_ or pretty much any adult animation).

She&#8217;s too nice.

A friend of mine phrased it well &#8211; she said &#8220;you need a sweet and sour girl&#8221;. She&#8217;s right.

Carrie&#8217;s just too sweet.
