Today&#8217;s Chicagoist includes an [interview with Michelle &#8220;Toots&#8221; L&#8217;Amour][1], of Lavender Cabaret:

> **ML:** I’m “the ass that goes pow!” (laughs) Have you seen the move?
  
> **C: I’ve seen a couple of the shows but I don’t know if I’ve seen that move.**
  
> **ML:** I could pull it out right here but I won’t. You could just tell people that I did.
  
> **C: I have journalistic ethics, I don’t think I can lie.**
  
> **FV:** I thought that WAS journalistic ethics. 

I saw Lavender Cabaret perform at my friend Lou&#8217;s birthday party a couple years ago. They were awesome. And hot. Awesomely hot.
