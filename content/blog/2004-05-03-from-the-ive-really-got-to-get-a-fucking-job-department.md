So I&#8217;ve been working on this for a few days on and off, but I&#8217;ve finally created a mood icon set using just pictures of myself, because yes, I am that egocentric.

So unless you&#8217;ve got mood icons over-ridden with your own on your friends page, you should see random pictures of me in my posts.

Wow. I&#8217;m a freak on wheels.
