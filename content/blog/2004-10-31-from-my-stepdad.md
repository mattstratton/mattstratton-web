(FYI, I did check this on <a href="https://www.snopes.com/sports/football/election.asp" target="_blank">Snopes.com</a>, and it&#8217;s legit&#8230;I mean&#8230;statistically)

The outcome of Washington Redskins football games has correctly predicted the winner of every U.S. presidential election since 1936.

The Redskins have proved to be a time-tested election predictor. In the previous 15 elections, if the Skins have lost their last home game prior to the election, the incumbent party has lost the White House. When they have won, the incumbent has stayed in power.

**The Green Bay Packers beat the Washington Redskins 28-14 today.**
