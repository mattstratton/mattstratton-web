[Photo reveals double curse in &#8217;86][1]

> That&#8217;s right: What Hintz spotted &#8212; and what Uni Watch and countless other researchers had missed over the years &#8212; was that _Bill Buckner was <a target="new" href="http://static.flickr.com/113/267804937_5d40215ca4_b.jpg">wearing a Chicago Cubs batting glove</a> under his first baseman&#8217;s mitt_. (And no, that&#8217;s not a Photoshop job &#8212; it&#8217;s the real deal.)

> The poor Red Sox. It&#8217;s bad enough they were saddled with one curse; they didn&#8217;t know they were actually fighting two of them. No wonder Buckner missed that ball. He never had a chance.</blockquote>

> I&#8217;ll be honest. I&#8217;m not that kind of Cubs fan who believes in curses, or at least, believes in blaming shoddy team performance on curses. But this makes me shake my head a little.
