Came home today to find my offer letter from the Bank.

\*phew\*

One less thing to worry about. The only thing that sucks is it kind of screws up my paydays &#8211; I won&#8217;t get my first check from the bank until the end of the month, and my last check from TAC will be a week from tomorrow. I&#8217;ll just have to be a little frugal after I get back from NYC.
