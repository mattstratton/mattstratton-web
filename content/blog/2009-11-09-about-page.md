I&#8217;ve been giving a lot of thought to redesign/improvements to this fancy-pants blog here&#8230;and one area that I&#8217;ve always known to need improvement is my <a href="/about" target="_self">About page</a>.

It&#8217;s pretty basic right now, as you can see.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/about-page.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5622" title="about-page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/about-page-300x175.png" alt="about-page" width="300" height="175" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/about-page-300x175.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/11/about-page.png 584w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
</p>

Pretty sparse, right? And it certainly doesn&#8217;t tell you anything about me. Matt Cheuvront over at <a href="https://www.lifewithoutpants.com" target="_blank">Life Without Pants</a> has <a href="https://www.lifewithoutpants.com/blog-insight/what-does-your-about-page-say-about-you/" target="_blank">a GREAT post about improving your About page</a>&#8230;and WHY you should put in the effort. Inspired by this, I am moving on with the process of making a truly rockin&#8217; About page. But I need some help in figuring out exactly what direction to go.

### What more do you want to know?

Content would be job one here &#8211; what more can I tell you about me? Should I include autobiographical information? Would a link to my résumé be interesting? Do you care about my family?

### Format and presentation

It seems like having an introductory video on your About page is the new hotness. I suppose this is also way more popular if the person in question is a mondo-hot specimen, but I can see the value and engagement potential of adding video. What do you think? Do I need more pictures, maybe? What else can I do with the presentation of this page to really make it feel engaging and personal?

### Speaking of engagement

I&#8217;ve got comments enabled on my About page. Does this make sense? Is this the kind of page people comment on? Or would I be better served just adding a link to my Contact page here?

I&#8217;m looking forward to any feedback you, my loyal readers, have on this topic. I really do want to open up this blog and make the experience more rewarding&#8230;and polishing up the About page seems like a great place to start. What do you think? What have you done with YOUR About pages? What do you like about other About pages you&#8217;ve seen?
