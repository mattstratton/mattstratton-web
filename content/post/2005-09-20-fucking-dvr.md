<span class="postbody">I AM SO PISSED OFF I COULD SPIT.</span>

My stupidmotherfuckinggoddamnpieceofshitfuckmeintheassmotherfucker Comcast DVR didn&#8217;t record Arrested Development last night.

Oh sure, it never misses an episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Taradise</span>, but this, the best show IN THE HISTORY OF TV INCLUDING THE TIME THAT SOME DUDE WALKED ONT THE FUCKING MOON, it misses.

Fuck Comcast in their stupid asses.
