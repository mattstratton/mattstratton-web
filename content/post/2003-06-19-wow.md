OK, so I had a date tonight.

I wasn&#8217;t sure it was a date at first&#8230;a girl replied to my personal on Yahoo&#8230;which I posted several months ago.

We chatted online for a week or so&#8230;she just moved here from Tennessee, and seemed mostly interested in just meeting new people and making friends. Which is cool.

So tonight we went to see Pete play&#8230;that was fun, and then we went to the Gingerman for some beers.

Had a really great conversation&#8230;and there seemed to be some good flirting feeling going on, so at one point I just leaned in and kissed her.

She enjoyed that :)

The evening progressed positively from there. So we&#8217;re definitely going to be seeing more of each other. I need a nickname for her (like the Gaga Girls or Spunky Orange).
