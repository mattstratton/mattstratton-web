So last night Carrie and I bought furniture for the first time together. Funny thing was, as we walked into the store, Carrie got really excited.

&#8220;We&#8217;re buying furniture together,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I feel like this is a really big step in our marriage.&#8221;

I was a little confused. &#8220;But, we bought a car together. That car was a lot more money that this furniture will be.&#8221;

She shook her head. &#8220;No, this is different.&#8221;

Anyway, we got a new couch and a new dining room table. Our current couch is pretty much shot &#8211; although I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll get some cash for it on Craigslist. The new couch is not a sleeper, but we don&#8217;t think we needed one, since we have a) a guest room and b) an air mattress. The new couch is really comfortable, and made out of a fabric that should be pretty easy to wipe Scout fur off of. This will be a good couch to put in the basement/family room when we finally get a house.

The dining room table is much bigger than our current one (well, it can be, with the leaves in). We also now have six nice new dining room chairs.

We got a pretty darn good deal on all the furniture (yay JCPenney!) It gets delivered a week from today. Funny thing is &#8211; the furniture will be delivered during the day, and then I will be picking Carrie up from work so we can go Up North. So she won&#8217;t get to see our new stuff until we get home late on Sunday night.
