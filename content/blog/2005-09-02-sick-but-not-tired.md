I seem to have come down with Sonic Death Flu again.

It started on Wednesday night. When I was on my way to the Z-Trip show, I felt a little tickle in my throat, but didn&#8217;t think much of it.

Then, yesterday, I woke up about an hour before my alarm went off, with a really REALLY sore throat. Could barely swallow. It sucked.

I worked from home yesterday, taking a few naps, mostly.

Now I&#8217;m up at 4:30 am talking to about Hi Ricky because I can&#8217;t sleep. Clearly Friday will be another work at home day. Which sucks &#8211; Friday is Jeff&#8217;s last day at the bank, and we&#8217;re all supposed to go out for drinks that afternoon. But since I am having trouble walking all the way accross my apartment right now (seriously &#8211; yesterday afternoon I went to the cash machine that is accross the street, and it felt like I was walking a mile), I doubt I&#8217;ll be able to make that.

Sucktastic.
