What a long weekend. It was the [Black and Tan Fantasy][1], and I am beat!

Hmm&#8230;they gave me a new compooter at work. I can&#8217;t use it until they image it, but it looks a lot better than my old one. Pentium IV with a DVD-ROM drive (for what??)&#8230;have no idea how much RAM.

Black and Tan as fun. I&#8217;ll post more once I get some sleep. But suffice it to say that I had an Errol Flynn/Clark Gable look going on Saturday night.
