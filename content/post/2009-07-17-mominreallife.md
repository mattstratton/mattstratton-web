_For those of you not familiar…Fussy Follow Friday is based upon the concept that instead of a glut of Twitter follow recommendations, I will make one, and ONLY ONE, follow recommendation per Friday. For more information, the Library of Congress recommends <a href="../2009/07/10/2009/06/10/fussy-follow-friday/" target="_self">this blog post</a>._

[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5457" title="mominreallife" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/mominreallife.jpg" alt="mominreallife" width="121" height="112" />][1]It&#8217;s Friday&#8230;so you know what that means&#8230;it&#8217;s Fussy Follow Friday time! Today we bring our focus to someone who mixes hilarity and social consciousness in their tweets&#8230;<a href="http://twitter.com/mominreallife" target="_blank"><strong>@mominreallife</strong></a>.

You meet a lot of people in the wacky world of the twitterverse&#8230;and sometimes, you actually even get to meet them in real life&#8230;or as the twitterati call it, &#8220;3D&#8221;. I had the pleasure of making a meatspace connection with <a href="http://twitter.com/mominreallife" target="_blank">@mominreallife</a>, well, in real life, a little while ago at a tweetup that was scheduled around her birthday. Of course, I met other bloggers and twitter folks that night too, but in the spirit of Fussy Follow Friday, I can&#8217;t discuss them. Rules are rules, people.

<a href="http://twitter.com/mominreallife" target="_blank">@mominreallife</a> is not afraid to share her many opinions via her tweets, as well as on her blog. To call her an &#8220;engaging&#8221; twitterer would be akin to referring to Chicago as a &#8220;town&#8221; &#8211; it goes well beyond that. Of course, one of the most important things to know about <a href="http://twitter.com/mominreallife" target="_blank">@mominreallife</a> is that she, alledgedly, has mad Mario Kart skills &#8211; there&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=101639503069&amp;ref=nf" target="_blank">entire Facebook group</a> dedicated to people who are nursing their wounds from a <a href="http://twitter.com/mominreallife" target="_blank">@mominreallife</a> Kart beat-down.

Why should you follow <a href="http://twitter.com/mominreallife" target="_blank">@mominreallife</a>? Because she&#8217;s a refreshing voice in the twitterverse, she&#8217;ll make you laugh, and you might even learn something. I&#8217;m not sure WHAT you&#8217;ll learn, but that&#8217;s part of the fun.
