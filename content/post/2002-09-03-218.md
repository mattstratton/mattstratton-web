Just got home from Vegas. I think I&#8217;ll post up comments tomorrow (after [Eli][1] gets his pictures up).

Suffice it to say, I had a damn good time. And I got a great massage at the Venetian spa yesterday&#8230;it was a perfect way to cap off a great weekend. Tom&#8217;s a smart motherfucker for thinking of that idea.
