We still are in need of a couple more extras for our shoot on Saturday, May 31&#8230;if you&#8217;re in the Chicago area and have nothing to do this Saturday (either from 8:30 am to noon, or 12:30 PM to 4 PM), shoot an email to **[production [at] gravytrainfilms [dot] com][1]** with your name, phone number, and email address (and preferred time slot) and we&#8217;ll hook you up.

We can&#8217;t pay you, but you&#8217;ll get a credit in the film, and access to the craft services food table :)

Thanks!
