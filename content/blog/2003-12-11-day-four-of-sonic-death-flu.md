Yup. Still sick. It&#8217;s getting worse. I was going to go to work today but I almost passed out in the shower. Eep.

I&#8217;ve just been sleeping a lot and taking Tylenol and eating soup and drinking water and juice. This shit has to stop; I&#8217;m a contractor and do not have any so-called &#8220;sick days&#8221;. If I don&#8217;t go to work, I don&#8217;t get paid. Period.

This sucks.
