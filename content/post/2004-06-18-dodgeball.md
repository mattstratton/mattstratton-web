I saw _Dodgeball_ today.

Maybe it&#8217;s just because the last movie I saw was _Soul Plane_, but damn, did I enjoy this flick.

I was expecting it to be somewhat humorous, and also expected that all the funny stuff would have been revealed already in the numerous commercials/trailers I&#8217;ve seen.

I was wrong. It was a LOT funnier than I&#8217;d hoped for, and quite a few really funny things (in fact, some of the funniest stuff in the movie) were complete surprises.

I can&#8217;t recommend this movie enough.
