Ah. So nice to be home again. Spent the evening with , , and . We had some yummy dinner prepared by Tracy, and then proceeded to get really kind of drunk and played &#8220;Loaded Questions&#8221;.

The picture seen here are those three cats watching the rain come pouring down in the backyard. It&#8217;s just really good to be back home with my pals. Not that I didn&#8217;t like the friends I went to visit, but sometimes there really is no replacement for the old homestead.
