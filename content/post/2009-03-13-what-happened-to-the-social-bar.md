You might notice a bit of a change today &#8211; the Google Social Bar, which used to be on the bottom of the page, has been removed. This is because it was causing some wonkiness with the top banner for users of IE6. Christina pointed this out to me, and I determined that yes, it only affects IE 6 users. However, looking at my stats, that is 13% of my traffic (and one of my most dedicated readers).

So, until I can figure out how to make the Social Bar play nicely with my theme, I will have to keep it off.
