So as promised, here are pictures of the three girls described in my [previous entry][1]&#8230;

First we have the girl who seemed to find it a chore to spend ANY time with me:

Next, is the completely insane woman&#8230;

This is the girl I referred to as &#8220;S&#8221;&#8230;the one who told me to lose weight (the guy she was flirting with is in the first picture I posted):

Lest you think me a bad person, I set this up so you&#8217;re the only one who can see it&#8230;
