I have a monthly subscription with [Audible.com][1], which means I can download two new audiobooks a month (it&#8217;s cool, because they don&#8217;t expire). Now that I have a bigger ipod, I have been more into the audiobook thing.

Last night I got _A Confederacy of Dunces_ (since is always raving about it) and _The Time Traveler&#8217;s Wife_ (which I&#8217;ve already read). Last month I had gotten _The Republican Noise Machine_ (since the book was recommended by a friend), but I couldn&#8217;t get through it, since the guy doing the reading was so abrasive. Ouch.

I really enjoyed the audiobook of _My Life_ &#8211; Bill Clinton was a wonderful reader, and his book is really folksy and entertaining. And, of course, _America The Audiobook_ was the best one I&#8217;ve gotten yet.
