I&#8217;ve been reading random LJ&#8217;s again&#8230;and I&#8217;ve noticed that there&#8217;s quite a trend in posts that read, in effect, &#8220;I love my boyfriend! Have I mentioned that I love my boyfriend? Guess what I did today? I told my boyfriend that I love him!&#8221;

Now, the question is&#8230;why does this seem to be predominately a female behaviour? I haven&#8217;t come accross too many LJ&#8217;s of men going on and on about how much they love their girlfriend. Of course, this could be because, [as Adam Carrolla says][1], all men on LJ are gay.
