I always want to remove all the Apple and Mac LJ communities from my friends list for the first few days after a Jobs keynote. Because it&#8217;s post after post after post about the same info we ALL read already on /., MacNN, etc etc.

Then the complaints start coming in.

&#8220;I like the Mac Mini, but it won&#8217;t work with my old ADC monitor. What a ripoff. Apple should have considered their existing customers who have old gear when they were designing a product aimed at switchers!&#8221; or &#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t they have put in a super fast top of the line graphics card and a G5 processor? This is such a rip off&#8221;.

As someone pointed out on Slashdot &#8211; first you complain that Macs are too expensive. Then when they finally make a good one (just as powerful as my Powerbook) in a reasonable price range, you bitch about how &#8220;underpowered&#8221; they are. And you can&#8217;t even bitch about the one-button mouse anymore &#8211; the MM doesn&#8217;t come with one.
