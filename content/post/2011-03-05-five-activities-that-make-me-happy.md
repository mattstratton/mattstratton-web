Today&#8217;s <a href="https://challenge.meyouhealth.com/signup" target="_blank">Daily Challenge</a> from <a href="https://meyouhealth.com" target="_blank">MeYouHealth</a> is to:

## <a href="https://challenge.meyouhealth.com/2011/3/5/write-down-5-activities-that-make-you-happy" target="_blank">Write down 5 activities that make you happy.</a>

Without further ado&#8230;

  1. **Riding my bike** &#8211; I don&#8217;t do it nearly enough, but a good bike ride always puts me into a great mood.
  2. **Playing with my boys** &#8211; No matter how I&#8217;m feeling, getting down on the floor with Henry and Joey is guaranteed to lift any depression or funk.
  3. **Figuring out the solution to a technical problem** &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if this qualifies as an &#8220;activity&#8221; as much as a &#8220;result of an activity&#8221;, but when I come up with a solution to something that&#8217;s been puzzling me, I&#8217;m always happy. Like, really happy.
  4. **Going on a date with my wife** &#8211; Another one of those things that we rarely get to do, but getting out as &#8220;grown ups&#8221; without the kids is a joy when it DOES happen.
  5. **Reading a fascinating sci-fi book for the first time** &#8211; I do a lot of &#8220;re-reading&#8221; of favorites, but when I find a book that is super engaging, the first time through that book is amazingly pleasureable.

What about you? What are five activities that make YOU happy?
