I&#8217;ve got a few minutes before my first meetings of the day, so it&#8217;s as good a time as any to post to the Lizzle Jizzle.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Hey Hey</span>  
Baseball season is in full swing, and the Cubs finished off their first homestand 3-3. Not too shabby (although they were off to a rough start). I didn&#8217;t get to Opening Day, but I did go to the second game. It was great to be at Wrigley, but the Cubs put on a shoddy performance. I&#8217;m looking forward to going to a lot more games this year (a friend of mine and I bought into someone&#8217;s season tickets this year, so I&#8217;ve got tickets to 18 games. Whoohoo!). And it&#8217;s just nice to see a player the Cubs bought living up to the hype. Yay Fukudome!

<span style="font-weight:bold;">House Hunters</span>  
Our home search for the Suburban Exodus 2008 kicked off &#8220;for real&#8221; this weekend (we&#8217;ve been looking online for a few months already) with Carrie and myself going to look at some houses on Sunday. We saw a nice little house in Glen Ellyn that we really liked, but we&#8217;d probably outgrow it in about five years. We did find a [great place in Winfield][1] that looks promising. We&#8217;re still a couple months away from &#8220;pulling the trigger&#8221;, but it was good to get out and make it real.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">So Say We All</span>  
FINALLY, <span style="font-style:italic;">Battlestar Galactica</span> is back on. I found Friday&#8217;s episode a little anti-climactic, probably because I was SO jazzed up for it, and then&#8230;nothing much happened. I mean, nothing much that we didn&#8217;t already know &#8211; a lot &#8220;happened&#8221;. I&#8217;m hoping beyond hope that they do something interesting with Starbuck rather than just play out a lot of &#8220;is she a Cylon? Who knows?&#8221; stuff. Mostly, though, it just seemed like it was a lot of setup for the season, which, given the past season premieres, was a little slower than I&#8217;d wanted. But still it was frakin&#8217; awesome.

Other than that, not a lot to report. So happy that the weather is finally turning around; going to be time to start biking again I think.
