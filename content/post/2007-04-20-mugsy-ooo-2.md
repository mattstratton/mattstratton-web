In about two hours, I&#8217;ll be heading over to Wrigley Field. From that point on, I will be pretty much offline until Tuesday night. Email still will work to reach me (yay BlackBerry!), but I won&#8217;t be bringing my laptop to Vegas, so I won&#8217;t be reading LJ or commenting on comments/replies, etc, etc.

Why can&#8217;t it be 1:20 already??
