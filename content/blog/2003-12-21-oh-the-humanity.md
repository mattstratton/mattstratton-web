**Crispy Freestyle**

(Not work-safe, windows media file. But oh so funny. In a scary way.)

Lyrics transcibed by Keith

**CRISPY FREESTYLE**

[INTRODUCTION]
  
Meet me, meet me, meet me, meet me,
  
Meet me, don&#8217;t beat me.
  
Just meet me at the waffle house&#8211;I&#8217;m a mouse, from Ecuador,
  
You&#8217;re a duck and you&#8217;re a ducky whore.
  
You like to suck duck dick all day,
  
I like to suck mouse dick all day too,
  
but that don&#8217;t mean I am a Jew.
  
I am a rat bastard, and I&#8217;m a rapper
  
that&#8217;s a crapper,
  
I don&#8217;t like to rap too much because I know I can&#8217;t do it,
  
but you know what? My rhymes are fluid, so I don&#8217;t wanna not,

[HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH WOMEN]
  
I just wanna give you a pizza pie and say &#8220;That&#8217;s Amore&#8221;,
  
that&#8217;s a whore-ay, suck my dick all in its glor-ay,
  
it&#8217;s only three inches but that&#8217;s ok,
  
you can fit it in your throat piece,
  
and you don&#8217;t have to worry about anything,
  
it&#8217;s a nice little tiny package, and you know what?
  
It&#8217;s all yours&#8211;for the small price of twenty-nine, ninety-nine,
  
So let&#8217;s go do some lines or we can not do drugs,
  
and we can just chill out with my thugs
  
from Westchester the best-chester.
  
We got all the honkies in the world,
  
we like to take little girls
  
on the Zone Coaster
  
and then put &#8217;em in the toaster,
  
until they&#8217;re nice and brown.
  
Until they hear the nice sound
  
of me rhymin&#8217;, on-timin&#8217;,
  
I say I want the diamonds,
  
I want the ducats, I want the buckets,

[HIS ABUSIVE HOME LIFE]
  
I wanna just say &#8220;Fuck it,
  
Mom! I don&#8217;t wanna go to bed,
  
let me stay up another hour,
  
I&#8217;ll take a shower in the morning before I go to school.
  
Momma why you such a fool. Why you gotta play me?&#8221;
  
I ain&#8217;t gay, g. But my dad is,
  
that&#8217;s why he likes to fuck with other men,
  
that&#8217;s why looks like a little hen,
  
that&#8217;s why he likes to fuck and say he knows about yen,
  
but he&#8217;s never been to Japan,
  
so take a frying pan and slap me with it.
  
Man, that&#8217;s what you wanna do, I know it,
  
I learned it from you, Dad. I learned it from you.
  
That&#8217;s why I do this. That&#8217;s why I drink Chris(?),
  
that&#8217;s why I drink piss from old businessmen,
  
when they piss in my mouth, and they treat me like you,
  
Dad. Like you, you, you.
  
I wanna be a Jew, like Sammy Davis Jr.
  
Oh my God, I&#8217;m like Junior Mints.
  
Let&#8217;s talk about that for a second.
  
Vote for our fuckin&#8217; record
  
I wanna eat butter pecans and
  
I wanna change my name to Sam the Man,
  
and I want a golden ham for my birthday.
  
Daddy I want the golden goose,
  
Daddy I want a golden moose,
  
Daddy I want you to nail me in the caboose
  
with your fuckin&#8217; cock so,

[HIS LINGUISTIC PROWESS]
  
I wanna ronso Oh ronso, I hate you ronso,
  
I hate when I make up new words,
  
but I don&#8217;t hate when I make up new birds.
  
That&#8217;s a flying pickle-nu-nu-nu-nu,
  
that&#8217;s a flying pluka-laka-laka,
  
oh new birds I love thee,
  
Oh I love money, and I love Sunny D,
  
fuck the grape stuff or the purple stuff or the nurple stuff.
  
I just want the orange stuff,
  
I want the white stuff in my hair,
  
I don&#8217;t use nair on my back,
  
but I&#8217;m a monkey and I get funky.
  
And I&#8217;m a junky but that&#8217;s soooo&#8230; gravy.
  
Money train I get insane
  
muthafucka from New York come with it,
  
while I spin it, while I get with,
  
I&#8217;ll fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, for you,
  
for you and your crew, and I&#8217;ll just say it&#8217;s so greasy, easy.
  
I like peasy, it&#8217;s a funny word.
  
I like funny words. I like funny words.
  
Amen.
