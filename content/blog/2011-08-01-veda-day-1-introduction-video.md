description: This is the first day of VEDA - Video Every Day in August. Today's video is a small introduction...kind of a "meet and greet". It also includes a couple small snips from a few short films I made years and years ago.

Apologies for the quality of the clips from DWG, I:M, and I:S&#8230;the versions I found on my computer were not exactly the highest resolution ever.
