OK, so I found out today that apparently I will be no longer working out of our downtown office, but going back to the suburbs.

This is the suck. Not to mention the fact that I am underpaid and will remain a contractor &#8220;indefinitely&#8221;. This is a problem mostly because my contractor rate is super low, but I agreed to it only because it was supposed to be a 3 month contract, and then a perm gig at a much higher salary.

That was over six months ago.

Anyway, so I am looking for a new job. If you know of anything in the downtown Chicago area, please let me know. I have oodles of experience with Microsoft BackOffice products, and am an MCSE NT and MCSA 2000. I am also a CCNA.

Thank you for your support.
