  - I’ve completed five weeks of P90X…which puts me at just under the halfway mark. I would venture to say that this is further than I’ve gotten in the past (technically, I did more than five weeks last time, but I didn’t do it properly, so I don’t count it). This was also the first time I’ve completed the Phase 2 full week (minus a day of yoga, which we’ll talk about later).

No weight loss to report – I’ve been wavering with a plus/minus of two pounds since I started (never going over 2 pounds more, or 2 pounds less, than my starting weight). Since the tale of the tape is showing reduction in inches, I’m not too upset about it. Well, a little, but not a lot.

## P90X Stats

This was the first week of Phase 2, which changes two of the resistance workouts.

### Chest, Shoulders, and Triceps

Definitely a boost in intensity in this workout compared to the previous weeks. Loved not having to do pull-ups, but the pushups are rough in this one (especially the clap pushups). Tricep work is also more intense than in the Shoulders & Arms routine as well. This being the first time I’d done the routine, I held back a little bit, since I didn’t know how to do the pacing. My thought was to bring more intensity in Week 6, which I sort of did (that was this morning, and you can see that in the chart).

Ab Ripper X continued to be an improvement, as I got myself up to 216 total reps.

### Plyometrics

Nothing super different to report from this week. I pushed a little bit harder, but I still falter trying to make it through all 30 seconds of each exercise. My goal for Week 6 is going to be to focus on duration and not intensity – modify some of the exercises so that I can hang through the full 30 or 60 seconds for all of them.

### Back and Biceps

Wow, what a killer of a day! Basically, it’s all pull-ups and curls. Over and over again. I love bicep work, so this was a fun day for me (minus the pull-ups). The killer was at the end, with the strip set of curls. I started with 25 pound dumbbells, and dropped five pounds with each 8 reps. By the time I got to the 10’s, I could barely lift my arms! Felt great though.

Once again, improved reps on Ab Ripper X to a total of 227.

### Legs and Back

The ultimate killer workout – since it’s two large muscle areas, I burn crazy calories on this day (always in excess of 1,000 calories). No major milestones this week, with the exception of adding a few reps to a couple exercises. This was the day that I managed to [put a dent in our wall][3] from workout out, however.

Boosted up the ARX reps to a total of 241, which I think is pretty impressive.

### Kenpo X

As before, my goal during the breaks is to do all of the jumping jacks (20 seconds worth) and the ten “X Time” jumps that Tony does.

I continued to accomplish that this morning, as well as gain a little bit more height in my kicks. One change this week – I didn’t shut the curtains of the patio door, so I had a bit of a reflective surface to see myself in, and I can see that my form is NOT as good as I might have hoped. Gives me something to work on going forward.

### Yoga X

Skipped Yoga this week. My plan is to swap Yoga (Thursday) with the rest day (Sunday) since it’s such a long workout. However, I wasn’t able to do Yoga yesterday since Saturday ended up being a long night, since the boys were up sick for most of it. No excuses this week, though!

## The week ahead

Plan for Week 6 is more of the same. I am going to try to focus a bit more on my diet – one goal is to limit myself to one major carb a day, and boost protein a bit more. And also to be more conscious of eating “junk”. Other than that, I’m going to just KPP (Keep Pushing Play) and hammer through Week 6 of P90X!
