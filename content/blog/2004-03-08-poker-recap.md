So Saturday night was our third Hold &#8216;Em Tournament.

Biggest one yet. 16 players duking it out in a table-stakes, No Limit game.

We started off at three tables &#8211; one of 6 and two of five. Said tables were to then collapse to two tables of six (one eliminated from each table of five and two from six). I sat down at a table with Backstreet, which became the table of six.

A few minutes into the tourney we heard Partytom (last tournament&#8217;s winner) yell from the front room &#8220;I&#8217;m out!&#8221; We all assumed he was kidding. Nope. He had gone all-in on the third hand and was eliminated, thus setting a new land-speed record for giving his money to Howard.

Of course a few minutes later, both Tosh and Sean were knocked off of our table by going all-in on straights WHEN THERE WAS A FLUSH DRAW ON THE BOARD. Dennis had the nuts and he took their money, collapsing our table. Backstreet didn&#8217;t even play one single hand, and I only won a couple chips.

Once the third table eliminated their person (Joe) after over an hour of play, we went down to two tables. I was at a table with Dennis ($32,000) (chip counts estimated), Lippy ($26,000), myself ($10,800), Backstreet ($10,000), Mike ($9,000), and Louis ($8,000).

I did two stupid things on this table. I went into a big bet against Lippy, thinking he was bluffing. This was dumb because I KNEW Lippy was playing super tight in the opening tables. So I dropped about $4,000 there. Dumb dumb dumb.

Then on the next hand, I was dealt 3-6 unsuited on the big blind. So the bet comes around to me and I fold. FOLD. On the big blind. Dumbass. Of course as soon as I did it I said &#8220;Hey, but if you saw my cards&#8230;&#8221;

Flop comes up 3-6-Q. Yup. I would have flopped two pair. And the winning hand was a pair. A PAIR. I would have won.

I was eliminated going all-in against Lippy on a flush draw; I had pocket clubs and two clubs came up on the flop. Turn was a diamond, but I went all-in for the river. Didn&#8217;t pull a club and Lippy had a high pair. I was out.

Final table ended up being , was short-stacked going into this final table, but she held strong. The final three were
  
Howard, Backstreet, and . It got down to Howard and Backstreet around 2:15 AM, and since they were relatively even on chip count (Backstreet had about 15% more chips) they agreed to just split 1st and 2nd prize.

All in all, a good night of poker.
