    If you follow me on Twitter, or are my friend on Facebook, you may have seen me posting links to various online articles about something called "Hyper-V". Basically, earlier this year, my team here at Apartments.com migrated our virtualization platform from VMWare to Microsoft's Hyper-V offering. Here's a listing of some of these articles.

If you follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/mattstratton" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, or are my friend on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/matt.stratton" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, you may have seen me posting links to various online articles about something called &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-v" target="_blank">Hyper-V</a>&#8220;. Basically, earlier this year, my team here at <a href="http://www.apartments.com" target="_blank">Apartments.com</a> migrated our virtualization platform from VMWare to Microsoft&#8217;s Hyper-V offering.

Microsoft wrote up a case study on this experience, and due to that, I&#8217;ve been interviewed by several trade publications and quoted in a few articles. I&#8217;ve collected them here for your enjoyment. It&#8217;s some tech nerdery, but even if you don&#8217;t totally understand the technology, I think that it&#8217;s an interesting story about the &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; tech &#8220;plumbing&#8221; that I do for a living.
