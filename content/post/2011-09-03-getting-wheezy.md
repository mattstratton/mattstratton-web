So there&#8217;s this YouTube dude called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/wheezywaiter" target="_blank">Wheezy Waiter</a>. I even met him a couple of weeks ago. But in spite of that, he&#8217;s really cool. And funny.

Check it out. If 200,000 people watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/?ie=UTF8&node=565122" target="_blank">one of his videos</a>, Intel is going to donate a crap-ton* of money to <a href="http://donorschoose.org/" target="_blank">DonorsChoose.org</a>, which gets technology into classrooms. Where it belongs.

So go watch the damn video. He needs a ton of views by sometime in mid-September (even though the video says Aug 31, apparently he talked his way into an extension. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/?ie=UTF8&node=565122" target="_blank">So watch it! </a>Several times. Every day. Thanks!
