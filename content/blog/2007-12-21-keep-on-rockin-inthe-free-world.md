Carrie and I have joined the masses and gotten hooked on Guitar Hero. Our copy of GH3 for Wii arrived yesterday. It was very exciting. I spent about three hours playing yesterday, and have almost completed Career Mode on Easy (yes, Trapper, I know I&#8217;m a wuss). I&#8217;ll post our GH &#8220;Friend Code&#8221; when I get home tonight for those of you (read &#8220;Nando and Marcelo&#8221;) who have GH for Wii.

My only GH experience prior to this was playing at Kevin and Nora&#8217;s on their 360. Here are the differences I can tell:

1) The guitar for the Wii is cooler, in that the Wiimote plugs into it, so there is rumble during Star Power, and you hear a &#8220;missed note&#8221; sound come from the guitar when you mess up.
  
2) There is no downloadable content for the Wii (yet). So that means we&#8217;re stuck with the songs it comes with for now.
  
3) No &#8220;quick play&#8221; co-op mode. Which is no big deal right now, since we only have one guitar (and you can&#8217;t buy extra guitars until Feb or so)
  
4) The &#8220;encore&#8221; songs from Career Mode are only playable in Career Mode &#8211; supposedly this was true on 360 as well, but they made the songs downloadable. I haven&#8217;t tried using the unlock song cheat code yet to see if that reveals them in the other modes.
  
5) I guess the graphics are better on 360 than Wii, although I can&#8217;t see that being a major issue, since I wasn&#8217;t doing a lot of watching of the graphics.

It&#8217;s a LITTLE annoying to have to insert and remove the Wiimote from the guitar; I suppose if you had a dedicated Wiimote just for the guitar, it wouldn&#8217;t be that big of a deal. But for now, it means that for our second Wiimote, we have to remove the sleeve, and go through all the brouhaha to go back and forth. Probably not that big of a deal.

In other Wii news&#8230;my sister in law gave me DDR for the Wii for my birthday. We played it once so far &#8211; it&#8217;s fun, although you have to use your &#8220;hands&#8221; as well as the dance pad (swinging the Wiimote and the nunchuk). That&#8217;s hard.
