<p class="MsoNormal">
  I’m reaching out to my network to see if any of you have some insight. My recently-graduated sister-in-law, Meggie, is looking for a job in the Chicagoland area. She’s pretty wide-open in her interests (her degree is in Organizational Communications). If any of you know of open positions within your firm that might be interesting to her, please let me know. She’s definitely interested in HR, but she would be open for positions in customer service, or similar – she’s looking to get “in the door” somewhere to get started and get a feel for what is out there and what she might want to do. Any ideas/suggestions/opportunities would be appreciated!
