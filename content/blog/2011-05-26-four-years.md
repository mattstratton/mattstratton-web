Four years ago today, I married my best friend in the world.

It’s been a crazy and awesome four years. In our first year of marriage, we bought ourselves a fancy-pants new SUV, aka “The Fay”:

Year two is when we <a href="/life-in-general/our-first-place" target="_blank">bought a new house</a>. I can’t seem to find a picture of it, so I took it from Google Maps. It’s kind of an older picture, since the “For Sale” sign is still in the lawn:

Year three of our marriage is when two big things happened – Carrie got pregnant, and the boys were born (these events are slightly related):

Year four has been the adventure of seeing Henry and Joey develop from tiny little infants into super crazy toddlers. Oh yeah…and getting pregnant again.



I can’t wait to see what the next four years bring for us. It’s been amazing so far and while we have our ups and downs, I would not be the person I am today if I had not said “I do” four years ago. I love you, Mrs. Stratton!
