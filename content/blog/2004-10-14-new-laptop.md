Since I&#8217;m on a new team at work, they had to get me a new laptop. It&#8217;s exactly like my old laptop except it has fewer Cheezit crumbs on it and it is lacking all of the stuff I need to get actual work done.

So despite the fact that I actually had a lot of work to do this afternoon, I spent most of the time getting applications installed, etc, so that I could do said work. And now the day is over, so the work shall wait for tomorrow.

The good news is&#8230;Rak found a sneaky backdoor proxy server that is part of JPMC that doesn&#8217;t block ANYTHING. So now I can get to Gmail again, which is good, because the webmail interface on my person webserver (the only one I could reach with the B1 proxy) is pretty craptastic.

I also was talking to another of the production engineers on my team today &#8211; apparently my new manager is really open to the &#8220;work from home&#8221; stuff &#8211; not permanently, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be working from home at least one day a week. They&#8217;re even talking about getting VoIP phones for us and stuff. Neat. The coolest part is that if I wanted to go out of town for a weekend to visit friends, as long as said friend has a broadband connection, I could visit one extra day and work remotely, for example. Gotta love that action.
