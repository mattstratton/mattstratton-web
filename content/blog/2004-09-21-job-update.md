So Jim just talked to me.

Apparently they are going through the chain to get the offer together. I guess he has to fill out paperwork, that goes to his boss, who then does his part, then it goes to his boss&#8217;s boss, and then to HR.

So he said it could be a couple days or a week or more. But he said it&#8217;s probably a done deal.
