That&#8217;s what I said to my friend Tom tonight at the game. More than once.

It was a nail biter of a game! So many ups and downs&#8230;one of the Marlins compared it to a boxing match. Which was a pretty good analysis.

One funny thing &#8211; these girls behind us in the bleachers told us that when the one girl went to the bathroom at a sporting event, her team always won.

So my buddy Tom and I started shouting at her, &#8220;GO TO THE [bleep!] BATHROOM!&#8221;

So she did.

And Sammy IMMEDIATELY hit a two run homer and tied the game
