****In 250 words or less, tell us what it feels like to be a real Cubs fan.****

Write about your first Cubs game. Your favorite player. A heart-stopping play. An unforgettable moment. The one that marked you as a Cubs fan forever.

Just write!

Because the fan who writes the winning essay will throw out the ceremonial pitch on Swedish Covenant Hospital Day, Friday, July 15 (Cubs v. Pirates), receive four game tickets and have their winning essay published in the Chicago Tribune.
