So I&#8217;m going to Ft. Lauderdale this weekend for SoFLEX. Ostensibly, I am going to see some friends and escape the ass-cold of Chicago. But I think maybe this time I&#8217;ll actually try to do a bit of dancing. And try to enjoy it like I used to, those many years ago.

I am trying to figure out why it is that I don&#8217;t enjoy it as much. And I think I&#8217;ve narrowed down the reasons.
  
**
  
Reason 1 &#8211; Fear.** For some reason, I think everyone is better than I am at dancing. The reason is probably because they \*are\*. This is why I rarely dance with someone I don&#8217;t know REALLY well &#8211; I don&#8217;t want them to think they wasted a dance on me when they could have been dancing with that &#8220;dreamy&#8221; lead who is so magical. At least with my good friends, I feel like we have fun just because, well, at least we know each other.

**Reason 2 &#8211; Boredom.** After a couple of songs, I get kind of bored.This is probably because I suck. If I was more creative, then I could see dancing a ton. I guess that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; the appeal of dancing for hours straight and doing nothing else. There are few things I would do repetitively for that length of time. Maybe I need to be more creative.

**Reason 3 &#8211; Physical Shape.** I&#8217;m hoping that having quit smoking will help with this one. Maybe if I don&#8217;t get winded, I&#8217;ll be willing to dance more songs in a row.

I think Reason 1 is the biggie. I don&#8217;t like doing things I am not good at. So it&#8217;s embarrassing for me to dance with someone who thinks I suck. But maybe I just need to embrace the suck. I mean, I know what I am doing. I can do a passable swingout. I know a couple cool turns. I know how to pay attention to the follower and try to play off of her. In theory, I should be an acceptable dance partner.

We shall see.
