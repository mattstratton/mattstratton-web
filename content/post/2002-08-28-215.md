I haven&#8217;t been updating a whole lot lately&#8230;and I think that&#8217;s because my life has been pretty boring.

Today I did some testing/development for the update to the discussion software for [Windyhop][1]. Actually got a lot done. That was good.

I put an Airport card in my imac&#8230;so now, once the WH server is shipped off, my whole network will be wireless. And I can move my cable modem and router into the frontroom so I can finally (six months after purchase) use my Audiotron. I hope that I&#8217;ll be able to make it work with OS X and Samba. Because I like having my Mac as my MP3 repository. What with the whole iPod thing and all.

(Addition &#8211; looks like it does.)

Whoa. It&#8217;s six already. I&#8217;m s&#8217;posed to meet up for C&#8217;s berfday dinner at 8&#8230;and I haven&#8217;t showered or dressed yet. I should get on that trolley.
