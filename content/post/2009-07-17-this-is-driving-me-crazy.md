For some reason, last night, while I was reading, I thought of a passage from a book. A book that I cannot, for the life of me, recall the name of, or even what it is about.

All the I remember is that there&#8217;s apparently some type of magic or other fantasy type action &#8211; and a child, or a teen, is trying to teach an older person how to perform this magic action. The dialogue goes something like this:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Child: </strong>You have to really *want* <something something something>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Older Person:</strong> &#8220;Want?&#8221; Hmm&#8230;it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve &#8220;wanted&#8221; something. When you get to be my age you stop WANTING things.
</p>

It&#8217;s something like that. I cannot figure out what I&#8217;m thinking of. It&#8217;s entirely possible this wasn&#8217;t a book, but a movie&#8230;any idea what it might be?
