For those of you who didn&#8217;t see it on Windyhop, or didn&#8217;t otherwise hear, Evin and Noah&#8217;s daughter was finally born.

> Kesiah Grace Galang was born April 10, 2006 at 6:09 pm. She weighed 7 lbs, 9 oz and immediately upon arrival, kicked the doctor and then pouted at him. She&#8217;s obviously nothing like her parents.

Here are some pictures!
