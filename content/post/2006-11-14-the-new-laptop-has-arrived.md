My laptop came today. Tomorrow I will be turning it over to a desktop tech to put the corporate image on it, but tonight I putzed around with it first. 

Experimented with VMware &#8211; installed a few virtual machines. This machine actually has enough horsepower that I could install a few small instances of other OS&#8217;s, just for fun. This could serve very useful in the future for testing. 

Not pictured is the 17&#8243; flat panel monitor that I also got for a secondary display, which is an upgrade from the 15&#8243; I&#8217;d been using. 

And I love having the wifi built-in. I was always bending the part of my PCMCIA wifi card that stuck out of the side of the computer. No good.
