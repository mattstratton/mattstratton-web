OK, remember [Prom Date Girl][1]?

I had emailed Marla asking her to send Prom Date my contact info, since we&#8217;ll both be in NYC for the Cubs/Yankees game, etc, etc. Never heard from either of them.

So tonight, on [Amy W][2]&#8221;s advice, I emailed Prom Date. Fifteen minutes later, I received this email:

 _Hey Matt!_

_Great to hear from you. Yeah, that would be fun. I haven&#8217;t gotten my
  
airplane ticket yet. ( which I should probably get tonight- since they have
  
good deals on Orbitz late Tues. night)  My cell is 773-\*\\*\*-\*\***.  I was
  
actually at the Cub Brewer game last night.  Talk to you later._

_Julie_

The &#8220;that would be fun&#8221; refers to this from my email:

_maybe we could meet up for a postgame drink or something like that_

__Promising start. I&#8217;m thinking the proper play is to just exchange info for the June weekend, and if things happen there, go from there, but don&#8217;t ask her out or anything prior :)
