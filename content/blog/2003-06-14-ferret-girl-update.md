Went out with Ferret Girl last night&#8230;

&#8230;and I&#8217;m still confused.

We met a friend of hers for dinner and drinks, and then went to go see yet another friend in an improv show (I&#8217;ll decline from commenting on the quality of said show).

Afterwards, we walked back to our cars. I gave her a hug goodnight, and she went for a kiss, which I accidentally ducked.

So who the hell knows.
