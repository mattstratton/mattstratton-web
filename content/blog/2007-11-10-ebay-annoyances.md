I don&#8217;t do a LOT of eBaying &#8211; I buy things here and there, and have, on occasion, sold something I don&#8217;t really need anymore.

Right now, I&#8217;m going through a major annoyance with a seller on the site. Here&#8217;s the rundown &#8211; I bought a set of books from him on Oct 10, and immediately paid in full via PayPal. Our chain of correspondence started five days later, on Oct 15.

    <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">Hello, I anticipate on shipping these books today. I do apologize in the late response. I was experiencing issues with my mail scale; it was giving me false readings and as a result I am having hundreds of packages returned due to insufficient postage.</span>

  <p>
    <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">I appreciate your patience. Please contact me if I may be of further assistance.</span>

    <span style="color:rgb(0,0,255);">It is now 12 days since I paid for this item and I have not yet even received a tracking number. I do not want to hear about how you are having problems with your scale. I want my merchandise shipped immediately. If you have already shipped, it, please provide me with the tracking number, as I have not received any information from you other than a note that your &#8220;mail scale&#8221; was malfunctioning.</span>

  <p>
    <span style="color:rgb(0,0,255);">I paid you immediately for this item. 12 days to wait is unacceptable. Please make this situation right. Thank you.</span>

    <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">Hello, I apologize I did not give you the tracking number when I responded. I had several hundred packages that were returned that I had to ship out immediately.

We reshipped it immediately and the new tracking number is [redacted]</span><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">. I realize the shipping mistake was my fault and upon receing the return all packages were remailed the same day.

    <span style="color:rgb(0,0,255);">The U.S. Postal Service was electronically notified by the shipper on October 18, 2007 to expect your package for mailing.

  <p>
    <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">Hello, I realize that it can be frustrating and I am doing everything I can to get this resolved. The number I provided is actually a delivery number and not a tracking number. I contacted the post office and they confirmed that most items with delivery confirmations receive a scan but it is not required to scan delivery confimation numbers until the package is delivered. They also stated that transit time for an item varies by location and the number of packages being sent to that location. The Postal Service allows 2-9 business days for media deliveries and may take up to a month.</span>

    <span style="color:rgb(0,0,255);">This is going on 19 days now since I paid for this item. I would think that if you knew you were shipping it late you would send it a more reliable way. I am becoming very upset. I want these books. In the future please provide a properly trackable shipping method when you have messed up the shipping as you did in this case. You have done nothing so far to alleviate this issue other than send messages. That is not good customer service. You messed up, you should do something to make it right. Giving excuses about the post office is NOT a way of making it right.</span>

    <span style="color:rgb(0,0,255);">So far I have been holding off on feedback because I feel like you honestly had some issues. But you do not seem to be doing anything to make up these issues which were YOUR FAULT not mine.</span>

    <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">Hello, I had several hundred packages that were returned to me and I have actually started to issue refunds for the shipping cost to all those have been effected and have already received their orders.</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">You are correct, the orderes should have been shipped expediated when they were returned. However, the last think on my mind was the shipping method, I had a heap of packages that had to be reprocessed and reshipped and contacting the people effected by it.</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">As for sending just messagers and your description of bad customer service. Once a package is delivered to the post office it is impossible to have it retrieved and reshipped expediated.</span><br /><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">I also noticed this morning that you had left me negative, I dont know if you noticed, but the favor has been returned.</span>

    A few days later, I opened a dispute with PayPal, and he has, as of yet, not replied to it. Unfortunately, eBay won&#8217;t remove his retaliatory feedback,but I&#8217;m not that concerned, as all my other feedback is good. Mostly, I&#8217;m just posting this so the handful of you who buy books on eBay can know to avoid this jerkface.
