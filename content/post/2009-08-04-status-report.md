About two weeks ago, I <a href="/2009/07/22/making-progress/" target="_self">posted my first &#8220;progress report&#8221;</a> on my fitness/weight loss program. It seems like a good enough time to post another one.

I&#8217;m into Week 6 of my <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml" target="_blank">Couch to 5K</a> program, and it&#8217;s really going well. I have not missed a single day of scheduled running, which I&#8217;m very proud of. My diet has been steady and I&#8217;m sticking to the &#8220;don&#8217;t eat like an idiot&#8221; program. I&#8217;ve also been bringing my lunch to work with me almost every day (at least four days a week) and in addition to the diet control that gives me, I&#8217;ve figured out that the cost savings will go a long way towards the diaper fund.

Weight-wise, I haven&#8217;t really lost much since the last report. This morning I weighed in at 232.4 pounds, which is only about half a pound less than two weeks ago. However, I was down to 230 on Sunday morning, and honestly, I&#8217;m not going to sweat the poundage, since I know that I&#8217;ve lost fat. I started tracking my waistline on July 26, and between then and August 3 (so a week) I dropped an inch. That was pretty good. Here&#8217;s my weigh-in report since my last post:

</p>

My running, however, is going really well. This past Sunday was the dreaded &#8220;long run&#8221; of Day 3 of Week 5&#8230;just to put things in perspective, until then, the longest running interval I had was 8 minutes. On Sunday morning I did a 20 minute running interval. It was tough, but I got through. I only had to walk during the interval for about 30 seconds, as is pretty clear in this graph from Nike+:

    Overall, though, my running program is going well. I&#8217;m actually signed up to run an 8K race at the end of September for PAWS (Pets Are Worth Saving). If you&#8217;d like to contribute towards my fundraising goal, I would very much appreciate it. You can donate (and learn more) <a href="http://bit.ly/HW7XM" target="_blank">here</a>.

    I know that lots of my readers are also working on fitness goals. How&#8217;s it been going? Any new tips or tricks to share?
