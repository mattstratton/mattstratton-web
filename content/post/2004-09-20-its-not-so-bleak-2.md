From an interesting (and somewhat amusing) <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&id=1885624" target="_blank">article</a> from ESPN:

_If you polled America&#8217;s baseball fans on whether this year&#8217;s Cubs are better than last year&#8217;s, we bet nine out of 10 would answer: No. But guess again. After 149 games this year, the Cubs are 83-66. A year ago, they were only 79-70._
