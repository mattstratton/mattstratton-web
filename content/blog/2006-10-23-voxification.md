Like , I am [contemplating switching from LJ to Vox][1]. No particular reason, other than the fact that, as my life has changed, I think maybe it&#8217;s time to start a new blog. My LJ has a tone that maybe I don&#8217;t want anymore &#8211; not that I want to delete it all, but I think it&#8217;s time for [&#8220;Matt Stratton&#8221;][2] to have a blog, not &#8220;Mugsy Malone&#8221;.

Anyway, while I play around with Vox, I&#8217;ll be probably posting to both. But if you want to track-a-doodle along with my Vox adventures while being an LJ person, you can always add to your flist and follow along that way.

If you want an invite to Vox, just send me an email (matt dot stratton at gmail) and I&#8217;ll sign you up.
