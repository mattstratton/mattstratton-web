Those of us who take the CTA to work were not terribly affected by the snow today. At least I wasn&#8217;t. My commute didn&#8217;t take any longer than usual (although I left later than I wanted to; I was going to go to the gym this morning, but snoozed the alarm and ended up leaving the house at 7:30 AM instead of 5:30 AM).

Carrie, on the other hand, had it worse. I think her drive out to Oakbrook took her over two hours.

Of course, this morning I had an email from asking me advice on bike commuting. As I looked out the window at the flakes coming down while writing him back, it made me hate him a little bit.
