You know, one thing I&#8217;ve noticed&#8230;

Everyone knows everything. Have you noticed this as well?

When I decided to make a movie&#8230;everyone had to tell me why it was a bad idea and how it would fail.

When I decided to go to bartending school&#8230;everyone had to tell me why that was a stupid idea, and NOBODY hires bartending school grads.

I know that often, people tell me this kind of thing because they are concerned. My mother being one of them. But I get upset when people act this way, because it implies that I DID NOT THINK MY DECISIONS OUT.

I rarely make rash decisions. Well, sometimes I do. But when it comes to jobs/careers/lifestyles, I do research and learn all I can before making a decision.

Before deciding to make _Dancing With Gaia_, I read all I could about feature film production and and the film industry.

Before deciding to try to make it as a filmmaker for two years, I spent a lot of time crunching number, and figuring out the best way to try to &#8220;make it&#8221;.

Before deciding to go to bartending school, I talked to many bartenders, as well as called several bars and hotels to see what they had to say.

I&#8217;m not a moron, people. I&#8217;m an adult. And I think things out. I appreciate your concern, I really do&#8230;but please don&#8217;t insult my intelligence.

(FYI, this post is more in response to a phone conversation with my mother than any friend of mine&#8230;although that was a catalyst as well. My roommate too.)
