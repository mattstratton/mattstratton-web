This morning I had my &#8220;orientation&#8221; with JPMC.

It was the normal, run-of-the-mill &#8220;first day&#8221; stuff. Benefits look pretty standard, although I noticed with the vision plan that I can get a discount for laser eye surgery stuff. I don&#8217;t know how much of a discount yet though.

When I got to work today, I had a new flat panel monitor waiting for me as well as a keyboard. This is going to take some getting used to; I&#8217;ve become very accustomed to using my laptop screen &#8211; don&#8217;t get me wrong; I like the extra real estate of two monitors. I&#8217;ll just have to get accustomed to not being right on top of the display.

Special good mojo vibes to Kim who hears the results for her fellowship today! Fingers crossed!
