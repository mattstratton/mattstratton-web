So as you may recall&#8230;I got yelled at by my boss a while ago for using AOL IM at work.

So yesterday I get the following IM from him (we have an internal IM client called Sametime that also can talk to AIM)

Mugsy&#8217;s Boss: How do you reach AOL IM via sametime
  
Mugsy: under people there is a link for log on to aol
  
Mugsy: people menu that is
  
Mugsy&#8217;s Boss: okay I have done that and logged in, how do I see people on AOL
  
Mugsy: you have to add them
  
Mugsy: like you add sametime folks
  
Mugsy: except that the &#8220;community&#8221; is aol not sametime
  
Mugsy&#8217;s Boss: okay, I don&#8217;t need to install AIM correct
  
Mugsy: that is correct
  
Mugsy&#8217;s Boss: thanks
  
Mugsy: np
  
Mugsy&#8217;s Boss: okay, I added a few ids. if they are online will it show ?
  
Mugsy: it should
  
Mugsy: just like in sametime &#8211; they will be green if online
  
Mugsy&#8217;s Boss: do you have an AOL I could test with
  
Mugsy&#8217;s Boss: I have tried this before, did not seem to work
  
Mugsy: I removed it all but lauraann has one
  
Mugsy: \***\***\***
  
Mugsy&#8217;s Boss: it worked, thanks
  
Mugsy: she just got an IM but she&#8217;s not sure it&#8217;s you
  
Mugsy&#8217;s Boss: needs2climax

Yup. He sent my female co-worker, (who also works for him) an IM from &#8220;needs2climax&#8221; (there are numbers in his IM name too, but I removed them, just like I starred out LauraAnn&#8217;s IM name).

Well, LauraAnn and I get a good laugh out of all this. The fella who sits next to me comes over to see what we&#8217;re laughing about. He just happens to be the Director of Internet Security Engineering for our company.

He was not amused. He officially requested a copy of the Sametime transcript from me. I just asked him that he not sell me out :)
