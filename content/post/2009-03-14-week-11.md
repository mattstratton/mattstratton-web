I know I just had a self-portrait post the other day, but that was &#8220;catch-up&#8221;. Now I&#8217;m back on track.

I took this picture in my backyard today. It&#8217;s great to be able to get outside again (55 degrees today). I had a bit of an audience for this shot; since the weather is nice, all of my neighbors were out. One of my neighbors asked what newspaper the pictures would be in (I guess my 40D and long lens have a pro look to them to a casual bystander). I also had to contend with my dog continually wanting to get into the shot.

I had a REALLY hard time picking which photo to use this week. If you&#8217;d like to see the six I chose from, check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mugsy/sets/72157615263793726/" target="_blank">Week 11 set</a> on Flickr.
