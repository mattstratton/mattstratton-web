Jody Gerut (who went to my high school, and his father taught physics there) just got [traded to the Cubs][1] for Jason Dubois.

_&#8220;I&#8217;m shocked,&#8221; Gerut said. &#8220;I grew up a White Sox fan but I&#8217;m going to have to get over that. It&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s an unbelievable franchise with a great ballpark.&#8221;_
