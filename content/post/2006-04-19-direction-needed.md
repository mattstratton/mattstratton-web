I&#8217;ve been in a bit of a funk, and trying to figure out what it is.

And I think I finally got it.

I&#8217;m bored.

I need a project or two. Something interesting. Sure, I like watching baseball, and talking about baseball, and reading about baseball&#8230;but that&#8217;s kind of&#8230;being on the receiving end. I&#8217;m not creating anything. I&#8217;m not \*doing\* anything.

The moviemaking doesn&#8217;t really happen anymore. I don&#8217;t do improv anymore. I need something like that to do to make myself feel, for lack of a better word, &#8220;special&#8221;.
