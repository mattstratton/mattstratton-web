&#8230;that LDR&#8217;s are a bad idea.

I have quite the infatuation with someone who lives 800 miles away. We have a really good rapport, and she&#8217;s helluva cute as well.

From conversations we&#8217;ve had&#8230;I think there&#8217;s interest on the other side (amazingly, for once, it&#8217;s not a one-sided attraction for me). But I know she&#8217;s not into the whole distance thing. And she&#8217;s probably right.

Since I&#8217;m hopeless, I was looking at my budget and realized that I could afford 3-4 round trip tickets a month to this location. Just to torture myself further.
