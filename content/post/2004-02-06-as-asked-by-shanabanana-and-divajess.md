As asked by :

_1. For serious, what&#8217;s the deal with &#8220;for serious&#8221;? Seriously._
  
I think I picked it up from <a href="https://www.davephotos.com" title="Lippy" target="_blank">Lippy</a>, who I think bastardized it from <a href="https://www.homestarrunner.com" title="h*r" target="_blank">Homestar</a>.

_2. What&#8217;s a decision you&#8217;ve made that didn&#8217;t seem like a big deal at the time but turned out to be largely influential in your life?_
  
Trying out for &#8220;You Can&#8217;t Take It With You&#8221; my sophomore year in high school. I was doing it mostly to show up my jackass speech team partner, and because of that, I pursued theatre all through high school and then into college.

_3. What&#8217;s something you have to have &#8216;just so&#8217;?_
  
Lots of things. Among them&#8230;my wallet has to be in my pocket just so&#8230;the windows and icons on my computer&#8230;books and videos have to be lined up&#8230;I&#8217;m kind of OCD.

_4. What annoys you the most when you see it on an online discussion board?_
  
Martinislayer.

_5. How do you eat a Kit Kat bar?_
  
Naked. How do YOU eat them?

As asked by :

_1. If you could go back and have a do-over on any particular period in your life, when would it be (if at all)?_
  
I think I would &#8220;do-over&#8221; the time that we shot _Gaia_; there&#8217;s a lot of things I would do differently.

_2. What is the most important decision that you have ever made?_
  
Deciding to \*not\* move to San Diego in 1999. If I had, I never would have met Dallas, never would have made movies, and all sorts of other things would have been so very different.

_3. If your apartment caught on fire and you only had time to grab 5 items, which would they be and why?_
  
My powerbook &#8211; it&#8217;s got everything on it. It&#8217;s my weapon, my tool, and my lover.
  
My cell phone &#8211; figure I&#8217;d have to get a hold of people since my house just burnt down.
  
My wallet &#8211; again, useful to have when your house is gone.
  
The box of digital master tapes for all GTF projects &#8211; completely irreplaceable.
  
A jar of pickles &#8211; I&#8217;d probably be hungry.

_4. What is your dream vacation?_
  
Going to Australia and hiking in the outback. For serious.

_5. If you could spend a whole day with me, what would you plan for us to go do?&#160;_
  
First I&#8217;d take you shopping to stores you wanna shop in, and then we&#8217;d do a little lunch, probably at the Cheese Haus, followed by some golfing. And then at night, we&#8217;d take in an opera, probably Die Fledermaus, and then I&#8217;d follow it up with a drive to a secluded beach where I&#8217;d pop on the radio and we could slow-dance till the sun came up.
