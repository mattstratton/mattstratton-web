My friends and are in the final ten for a cool little video contest at Gizmodo. Check it out.

> Drew and I recently entered in a contest at the gadget blog gizmodo.com to win a brand new IBM ThinkPad. The contest was to make a 60-second film noir called &#8220;Laptop Confidential&#8221; and upload it to YouTube.com &#8211; Drew and I pulled out all the stops and we ended up with a really great movie.
