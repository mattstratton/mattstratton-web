We are coming to the conclusion of VEDA &#8211; Vlog Every Day in August. The prompt for Day 30 was BLOOPER REEL! This video is a sampling of mis-steps, verbal tics, and other outtakes from my previous videos. It is rated NSFW due to language and adult situations. Also, I sing in it. I&#8217;m sorry.
