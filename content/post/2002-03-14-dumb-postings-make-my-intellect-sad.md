So it&#8217;s almost Black and Tan weekend.

We&#8217;re importing some cool cats for this joint&#8230;I&#8217;m hoping that we can live up to the hype. I had to do some damage control over at TWT today&#8230;lest someone&#8217;s post make it look like we&#8217;re a bunch of dance nerds in this scene. Yes, there ARE dance nerds in this scene. I&#8217;m not one of them.

I&#8217;m really tired. Larry got into town yesterday&#8230;we met up at Fizz (because I had to talk to the owner about getting permission to shoot there). Later on we met up with Ryan, MB, Hamster, MK, and Ryan&#8217;s friend Matt at Marigold to get our bowling on. I didn&#8217;t bowl exceptionally well &#8211; averaged about 120. Afterwards, watched some Clerks: TAS with Larry, and then went to bed.

Had to get to work somewhat early today. I dressed myself pretty badly&#8230;I don&#8217;t match. My pants and socks go together really well, but the shirt is WAY off. And my hair&#8217;s being crappy today too. And I didn&#8217;t bother shaving. Good thing I don&#8217;t much care how I look at work. I&#8217;ll fix that before going out tonight.

Need to do some laundry and pick up a bit tonight, before the mass entrance of house guests this weekend. Looking forward to seeing the finals of the ECS only contest. Plus, Matty Ballgame in the house! He got us a four-pack of Mike Barrett CD&#8217;s, autographed and everything, to auction off on Saturday. They will be mine. Oh yes.

Work is boring today. Boss is home getting his car fixed. Wondering if I can sneak out early. Jeff would probably be angry and shoot me. And I&#8217;m not a ninja, so I can&#8217;t defend myself.
