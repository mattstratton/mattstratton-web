**<font size="5">Farnsworth&#8217;s profile found on Match.com</font>**

<font size="2"><strong><em>The Daily Heckle, Tuesday, May 24, 2005</em></strong></font>

<font size="2">Several female Lakeview residents reported Wednesday that they found ex-Cub and current Detroit Tigers pitcher Kyle Farnsworth’s profile on the popular Internet dating Web site Match.com.</p> 

<p>
  Farnsworth, identified by username “Tallsexyheat,” is using an in-game action photo to attract potential companions.
</p>

<p>
  His ERA was not listed in his profile.
</p>

<p>
  “I’ve found it’s tough to meet chicks here in Detroit unless you play for the Red Wings,” Farnsworth wrote in his profile. “I can’t just stumble out of Wrigley into a pool of drunk hotties at Sports Corner anymore.”
</p>

<p>
  Once he got the hang of typing and spelling, Farnsworth navigated the dating site with relative ease.
</p>

<p>
  “I’ve got a babe coming out to see me pitch on the next homestand,” the reliever said. “Then we’ll hit a bar on the way back to my place in Royal Oak and, hopefully, there will be some hot bedroom action to cap it off.”
</p>

<p>
  He also noted how Internet dating has become a more accepted means of meeting someone—even for tall, attractive middle-relievers.</font>
