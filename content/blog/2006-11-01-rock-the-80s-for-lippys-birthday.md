I realize this is last minute, but anyway, if you&#8217;re in town and bored, come out to [Dark Room][1] tonight where DJ Porno Lippy (or whatever he&#8217;s calling himself these days) will be spinning 80s tunes. Plus, it&#8217;s his birthday. Plus, Carrie got a pretty good 80s outfit going. Plus, my 80s outfit sucks.

Plus, your mom.
