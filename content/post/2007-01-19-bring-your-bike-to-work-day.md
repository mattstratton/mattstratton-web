In honor of Chicago&#8217;s [Winter Bike to Work Day][1], I bike commuted for the first time since late October.

It was 25°F and clear, although it &#8220;feels like&#8221; 14°F.

It wasn&#8217;t really too bad &#8211; the cold wasn&#8217;t the problem; it was the &#8220;not having ridden to work in several months&#8221; that was the problem.
