He emailed me yesterday asking for my recommendations for the &#8220;must-have&#8221; apps for the iPhone.

Of course, since I am a &#8220;corporate shill&#8221; (<a href="/2009/06/03/iphone-twitter-app-shoot-out/" target="_self">according to Marcelo</a>) BlackBerry user, I don&#8217;t have personal experience with the super-duper awesome apps out there for the iPhone. I read about them, of course, and I am a proponent of the &#8220;there&#8217;s an app for that&#8221; joke, but in reality, I don&#8217;t know what is REALLY out there.

My wife is also on the cusp of iPhoning &#8211; we&#8217;re going to be getting her a 3G in a couple of weeks. I know she&#8217;s really excited about it, but she too is going to need guidance on what are the most important and awesome apps out there.

Therefore, I turn to you, loyal readers (and others) &#8211; what apps do you recommend for the following people:

  * **My father-in-law:** Not a Facebooker or Twitterer&#8230; is into photography, sailing, his grandchildren, and the news.
  * **My wife:** Doesn&#8217;t use Twitter, but loves the Fizzy Bizzy (Facebook, that is). She likes cooking,trashy reality TV, reading, celebrity gossip, and home decorating.

Please post your suggestions in the comments!
