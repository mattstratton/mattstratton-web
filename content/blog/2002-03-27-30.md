If any of the DWG cast is reading this&#8230;remember: &#8220;Truth does not necessarily equate to realism. Be truthful to the ridiculous.&#8221;

I think that I made such a big deal at the beginning of the workshopping about being &#8220;truthful&#8221; that the cast is now so worried about NOT being funny that&#8230;well, they&#8217;re not being funny. No risks.

I&#8217;ve never been a &#8220;traffic cop&#8221; director. I want my actors to make their own discoveries. But I&#8217;m finding that I&#8217;m going to have to direct some traffic here.

I want to see the actors grab on to a discovery, or a direction, or an initiation&#8230;and run with it, balls-out. They are scared, I think. Scared of taking risks, so they ditch things fast.

I think we&#8217;re going to do some more &#8220;discover, explore, and heighten&#8221; work next time.

Or maybe I&#8217;ll just write some dialogue.
