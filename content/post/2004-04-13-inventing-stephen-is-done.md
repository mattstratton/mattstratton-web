Just got back from Brian&#8217;s studio, where he was helping me do the final audio mix and soundtrack from _Inventing: Stephen_.

I&#8217;m so excited. It sounds great. So the DVD will be done sometime this week, so all of you who are owed &#8220;payment&#8221; for _Inventing: Music_ or _Inventing: Stephen_ (they&#8217;re both going on the same DVD) will be getting yours in the next couple of weeks. Nifty!
