Apparently there was just a big train crash in Elmwood Park. A Metra train hit a bunch of cars, and 13 people are injured.

Which is sad. But what&#8217;s REALLY sad is that witnesses are reporting that they saw cars going AROUND the barricades to cross the tracks.

What the FUCK is wrong with people?
