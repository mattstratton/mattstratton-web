So my flight home was originally supposed to leave Orlando at 3:50 PM.

We are now sitting on the runway and have been told that our next update on status will be at 6 PM. Not that we&#8217;ll be leaving at 6 PM&#8230;but next time we even hear anything. And even once we are wheels up, due to a reroute, our flight will be at least 40 minutes longer than normal.

I foolishly did not pick up any snacks at the airport, and even once we take off the only food that American has available will be a cookie, a small bag of nuts, or a small bag of chips&#8230;

&#8230;for $3 each.

This airline sucks. I know it&#8217;s not their fault we are delayed, but this food baloney is for the birds. Why even bother flying a more &#8220;premier&#8221; airline like American if the experience is sub-par.

I usually fly United and I like them a lot better. Sure, they charge you for food, but at least it&#8217;s more than just a stupid cookie.
