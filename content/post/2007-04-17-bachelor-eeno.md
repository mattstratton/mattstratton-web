It is 3 days, 3 hours, and 12 minutes (or so) until my bachelor party &#8220;officially&#8221; kicks off.

The extravaganza starts off with a 1:20 Cubs game vs the Cardinals with Tom, Chris, and Doug (a friend of mine from work). We&#8217;ve got some pretty good seats, and the weather is predicted to be &#8220;mostly sunny&#8221; in the high 50s, so it should be a lot of fun.

After the game, we join up with the rest of the party and &#8220;suit up&#8221; for dinner at a fancy-pants restaurant in North Center, and then some carousing in local watering holes.

Saturday, a smaller group will be flying out to Las Vegas for several days of various activities. Including some awesome food, such as In-And-Out Burger, Binion&#8217;s Steakhouse, and the buffet at Paris (mmm&#8230;crab legs).

I can&#8217;t wait.
