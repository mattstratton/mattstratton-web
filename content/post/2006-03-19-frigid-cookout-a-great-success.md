Man, was that a lot of fun. It had all the elements of my memories of this backyard &#8211; great food, plenty of booze, and Mark trying to set the yard on fire.

Some of the highlights included a [quadracycle race down the alley][1], chopping up the bench for firewood, and Ryan&#8217;s girlfriend replying with &#8220;that was sort of fun&#8221; when almost hit with a flaming piece of wood.

Good times.

The rest of the pictures are [here][2].

I&#8217;m going to miss this place.
