So this weekend was the big Halloween party.

I don&#8217;t have any pictures uploaded yet, but I&#8217;ll try to get some in the next couple of days.

I didn&#8217;t really drink much at the party; I was being Responsible Host Guy. Plus, I had to get up at 6:30 AM to go to the editing suite. That was rough, let me tell you.

I think this was the biggest party yet. We had to have had over a hundred people in our place all at the same time. Nothing major got broken (just some beer bottles and shot glasses). People were less &#8220;good&#8221; about the BYOB thing than ever before; luckily, we had a pretty well-stocked bar. And the neighbors let us have the remainder of their keg from the night before; that really helped.

Some highlights:

* Luv dressed as a &#8220;Girl Gone Wild&#8221;
  
* Dallas dressed as &#8216;Director Matt&#8221;
  
* Susanna&#8217;s &#8220;Dolly Parton&#8221; costume
  
* Trapper not breaking anything
  
* The fake &#8220;feet&#8221; on Tom&#8217;s &#8220;Fred Flintstone&#8221; costume
  
* Many hot chicks in slutty costumes

more later&#8230;
