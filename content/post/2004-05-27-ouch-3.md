So I had an interview today with another temp agency downtown, and decided to walk home.

This would have been fine (it was only about 4 1/2 miles), except that it got really warm (I was wearing a shirt and tie and my jacket) and I was wearing dress shoes.

I took a break about 1/4 of the way to stop by Boyband&#8217;s studio to say hi, but then it was a long walk home. By the time i got to Sheffield and Lincoln, my ass was dragging and my right foot was killing me.

So while I burned some good calories, I&#8217;ve got a nice blister on my right foot to remember it by. Blech.
