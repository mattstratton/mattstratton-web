So if you know and somehow haven&#8217;t heard about his Halloween/birthday party this Friday, let me know. It&#8217;s going to be awesome. Actually, even if you don&#8217;t know Lippy, but you know me, and are cool, and are going to be in Chicago, and like fun Halloween parties, let me know as well. Send me an email to [matt [at] windyhop [dot] org][1] and I&#8217;ll send you the scoop.

It is going to be really fun. And I have a great costume.
