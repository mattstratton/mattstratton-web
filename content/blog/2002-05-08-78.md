Spider-Man was a cool movie.

Went to see it with Em on our &#8220;friend date&#8221;. It was fun. We had sushi at Tombo and then saw the flick. We&#8217;ve never hung out together outside of a swing thing, so it was a good time.

I was all set to write more about the movie, but I just realized I&#8217;m tired.

More later.
