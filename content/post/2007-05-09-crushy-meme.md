1. List your top 10 celebrity crushes. _(I&#8217;m just doing five, as ten was way too many)_   
2. Put all of them in order of your lust for admire them.  
3. Say why you lust for/admire them and which movie/show/thing it was that hooked you.  
4. Supply photos for said people.  
5. Tag five people _(Tagging is dumb. Do it if you want to.)_

1. Liz Phair &#8211; I think it&#8217;s her voice more than anything else. It&#8217;s friggin&#8217; hot. I think it was also first sold for me on &#8220;Fuck and Run&#8221;.

2. Parker Posey &#8211; She&#8217;s terribly hilarious, and really really cute. I was &#8220;hooked&#8221; by _The House of Yes

</i>3. Christa Miller &#8211; She&#8217;s just cute. And something about her voice/inflection is a beautiful combination of grating and adorable. Although I don&#8217;t find her nearly as attractive on _Scrubs_ as I did on _Drew Carey_.

4. Sarah Silverman &#8211; she&#8217;s raunchy and Jewish. Enough said. Although my first crush developed when she was on _Greg the Bunny_.

5. Alexis Bledel &#8211; no, it&#8217;s not a &#8220;Rory&#8221; thing. I just think she was totally hot in _Sin City_.
