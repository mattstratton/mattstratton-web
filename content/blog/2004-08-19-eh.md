Boring night.

Nothing really fun&#8230;no online excitement (except for some amusing chatting with and ).

I might try to go to NYC next weekend or over Labor Day if anyone is around. and &#8216;s wedding reminded me of how much I like my NYC buddies and miss them. If I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll be there in Oct anyway.

I should go to bed, but I probably won&#8217;t. IM me if you&#8217;re around and want to entertain me.
