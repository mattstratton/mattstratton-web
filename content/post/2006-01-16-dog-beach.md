[Carrie][1] and I took [Scout][2] to the dog beach this morning (it was a pretty nice day). We had a lot of fun running around with him, and I got a bunch of [cool pictures][3] as well.

I think my favorite was when we met a cocker spaniel/Rottweiler mix. His owner told us that the refer to him as either a &#8220;Cockweiler&#8221; or a &#8220;Rotten Spaniel&#8221;, depending on how he&#8217;s behaving :)
