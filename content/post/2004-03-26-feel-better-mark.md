Here&#8217;s hoping a speedy recovery to my boy Mark Prior.

**[Chicago Cubs star righthander Mark Prior will start the season on the disabled list, the team announced Tuesday][1]**

In other news, I&#8217;m leaving for Atlanta in about 5 hours. Should be a weekend of good fun and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing old friends again, including who is also in ATL this weekend!
