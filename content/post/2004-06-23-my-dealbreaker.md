is going to laugh, but I think I&#8217;ve figured out my &#8220;dealbreaker&#8221;.

The girl can&#8217;t annoy me.

I don&#8217;t know what it is. But it seems that most of the girls I have dated or been on dates with or whatever&#8230;after a little while I just get so annoyed and want them to leave me alone.

Granted, I get annoyed with people in general. But I mean like sitting there and fuming and thinking &#8220;jesus christ, will you fucking LEAVE already?&#8221;

That&#8217;s not healthy.

There is a short list of people that I spend a lot of time with who don&#8217;t annoy me like that. The problem is, none of them are possibilities for dating.

On an unrelated note, I am digging this song I&#8217;m listening to right now. &#8211; have you heard it? I think you&#8217;d dig on it hardcore.
