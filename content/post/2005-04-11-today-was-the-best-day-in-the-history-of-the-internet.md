[**THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR threatens to sue SomethingAwful**][1]

Thanks to for alerting me to this.

Seriously, read the whole article. You will literally soil yourself with delight.

Some highlights:

_Imagine, the Ultimate Warrior on the Something Awful forums, suplexing nerds all over the joint and generally just tearing ass all over the Internet.</p> 

&#8230;

As you can plainly see, we&#8217;ve progressed from &#8220;lawsuit threats&#8221; to &#8220;stalking families and calling people ugly.&#8221;

&#8230;

My dad actually called me last night to say &#8220;some crazy guy phoned the house here. He called me a &#8216;candy ass&#8217; and then hung up.&#8221; I replied to him, &#8220;oh yeah, that&#8217;s this guy representing the Ultimate Warrior. He pretty much has an airtight legal case against us, which is why he&#8217;s spending his Sunday night calling you, my father.&#8221; My dad doesn&#8217;t understand the Internet as well as I do.</i>
