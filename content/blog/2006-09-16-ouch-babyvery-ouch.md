I am in some serious pain today.

Last night I went out drinking with Tom, Chris, and Lou.

We started at a very cool tiki bar out by Ohare.

The night ended with Tom and me at the Diner Grill at 4:30 am.

This picture is not from last night, but it&#8217;s a good picture to illustrate me being drunk. Which is what I was last night.

Today I am just feeling craptastic. Time to go take a nap.
