So I just got new contacts last night&#8230;and for the first time, I am wearing soft contacts.

I&#8217;ve been wearing hard contacts since I was 15. At the time I got them, you couldn&#8217;t get soft contacts with my prescription. A few years ago, I asked the eye doctor if I could get soft contacts, and he told me that after so many years of wearing hard ones, I probably wouldn&#8217;t like the soft ones.

Well, I tried soft ones. And they are a lot more comfortable, no question. But they are a LOT harder to put in and out&#8230;a lot more &#8220;sticking your finger in your eye&#8221; action, which I don&#8217;t dig on. But we&#8217;ll see. I am on a week trial; if at the end of the week I decide I don&#8217;t like them, we&#8217;ll order hard ones. If I do like them, they I get more soft.
