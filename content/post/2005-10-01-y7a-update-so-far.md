[**larrykang**][1] and I got into Manhattan around 1 or so yesterday (after meeting up with [**swingdoc**][2] at a rest stop and depositing her husband with her). I needed a new AC adapter for my handycam for Saturday&#8217;s &#8220;red carpet&#8221; carwreck, so we stopped at [B&H Photo][3] so I could get one. Stupidly I didn&#8217;t bring the camera in with me, so I couldn&#8217;t figure out which adapter to get. I decided instead to just get a new, cheap camera to use on Saturday.

After leaving, I look at the camera, and realize it doesn&#8217;t have a mic input. Therefore, useless to me. I&#8217;m a bit of a moron. Luckily, when I met up with Emmysue at George&#8217;s apartment, I discovered that he has a camera that he will let us borrow tonight. w00t. I am going to attempt to return my purchase on Sunday (B&H is closed today for the Sabbath).

Emmysue, George, and I traveled up to my [hotel][4], where I checked in. Got some Starbucks, and then George and I bought some suits at [Prato][5]. I got a nice black suit, shirt, and tailoring for $240, and it&#8217;ll be ready this afternoon for the event tonight. Awesome.

Met up with [**robertajean**][6], [**larrykang**][1], [**swingdoc**][2], Partytom, Cindy, [**atalanta74**][7], Nicole, and some other kids at Republic in Union Squre for dinner. It was pretty good (I realized after entering that I&#8217;d eaten there with [**nandoasti**][8] and [**jodiemim**][9] a few years ago before a UCB show). Cindy showed off her new [blinged-out belt buckle][10] (some of the messages programmed included &#8220;My Other Pussy Is A BMW&#8221; and &#8220;It Ain&#8217;t Gonna Lick Itself&#8221;) and after some Starbucks reinforcements, it was off to Flatiron Lounge for a pre-dance drink with [**swingfeline**][11] and other pretty ladies.

The dance was fun&#8230;and long. [**robertajean**][6] had made about 200 jello shots, of which I consumed more than my fair share (but hey, the money was for a good cause&#8230;I assume). Partytom made a lot of new friends, and even 8-months-pregnant [**swingdoc**][2] raged the party until 1:30 am. Headed back to the hotel around 3:30. I also danced twice (once with [**atalanta74**][7] and then I attempted to dance with [**glitterlisa**][12]. Hopefully she&#8217;ll give me another shot tonight.)

Today I am heading back down to Dance Manhattan in a few hours to teach my improv workshop, and then the lights and glitz of Y7A. Whoohoo!
