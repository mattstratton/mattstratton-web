I hate to disappoint, but today&#8217;s post is unicorn-free. Instead, the topic for today is how to vastly improve your computing experience with the addition of a couple of awesome utilities.

This is by no means comprehensive, but I hope that it might provide you with a few insightful suggestions for getting things done more efficiently&#8230;or at least more pleasantly. This post is going to be Windows-focused; in the future I may provide a similar post for Mac users, although it will probably just be several paragraphs talking about how awesome Quicksilver is.

Without further ado&#8230;on with the utilities!

In today&#8217;s electronic world, we all have a lot of passwords and sensitive data to manage. You need your Gmail password, your network login, your spouse&#8217;s Social Security number, and the private key for your PGP encryption. Well, okay, maybe nobody really needs to worry about that last one. But for everything else, **it&#8217;s essential to keep these passwords/secrets locked away somewhere other than the moleskin in your Crumpler**. And for that, I highly recommend the secure password manager, <a href="https://www.mirekw.com/winfreeware/pins.html" target="_blank">PINs</a>.

PINs is a totally free piece of software written by a fine fellow by the name of <a href="https://www.mirekw.com/" target="_blank">Mirek Wojtowicz</a>. It is lightweight and secure, using 448 bit Blowfish encoding. Yes, I said &#8220;blowfish&#8221;. If it made you giggle, then you don&#8217;t really need to know what it means. Suffice it to say it&#8217;s secure enough to store your ATM password, although why you would store your ATM password in a computer file is beyond me.

By this time, everyone is familar with the concept of PDF &#8211; or Portable Document Format. It&#8217;s a document standard created by Adobe that allows, amongst other things, documents to be created that don&#8217;t require native fonts and can basically look the same on any computer/platform.

The ability to open and view a PDF is absolutely necessary these days. If you happen to be running a Mac, this ability is built right into the operating system. If you&#8217;re using Windows, it&#8217;s a different story. Most people will tell you that you need Adobe Acrobat in order to read PDF files. And **while that definitely used to be the case, it&#8217;s no longer true**.  There&#8217;s nothing inherently wrong with Acrobat, except that it uses WAY more resources than necessary to do what it does &#8211; and it can be kind of slow. Enter <a href="https://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php" target="_blank">Foxit Reader</a>.

The fine folks at Foxit Software have created this incredibly lightweight PDF reader, which is my favorite tool for the job. It&#8217;s free, quick, light, and it also has the word &#8220;fox&#8221; in it, which makes you think of Firefox, which is awesome, so therefore, Foxit Reader gets a little of that coolness by proxy. Give it a try over Acrobat &#8211; I think you&#8217;ll enjoy it. Well, as much as one can be said to &#8220;enjoy&#8221; a PDF reader.
