As I mentioned before, Carrie and Scout are out of town this week. Last night was the first night since March that we haven&#8217;t spent the night together (yes, up North we slept in separate rooms, but we were still together, you know?)

I spent my evening doing manly, single guy things.

I watched three episodes of _Gilmore Girls_.

God, I&#8217;m lame.

Seriously, it&#8217;s a coincidence that I chose a photo of Nando for this post. I just really like this picture &#8211; I would like it better if the other two people could be cloned out, but that would take some hardcore Photoshopping.
