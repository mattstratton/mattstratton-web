So tonight, at our Chanukkah party, I found out that my friend Michael proposed to his girlfriend on Friday. Which is super awesome, since both of them rule.

And then I just find out that Dallas finally proposed to his girlfriend. Well, I mean, he&#8217;s done that before, but always on the phone and while drunk. I guess this time he did it for real.

Congrats to both Michael and Dallas, and their respective lady friends. I&#8217;m excessively happy for all four of you!
