Hi blog readers&#8230;I know I&#8217;ve neglected you horribly (I posted every almost every single day in February, but only twice in March&#8230;and here it&#8217;s halfway through April and this is my first post). But the good news is, this post is full of pretty pictures.

Back in March, I joined up with fellow local photographers <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/louisparks/" target="_blank">Louis Parks</a>, <a href="http://subism.com/" target="_blank">John Morrison</a>, and <a href="http://aveiphoto.com/" target="_blank">Allie Osmar</a> for a fun photoshoot project. We all met up at Chicago&#8217;s Millennium Park, and took it in turns to shoot the same set of models. The theory behind the project was to see how different photographers captured the same subjects in the same location in the same conditions.

The experience was really fun &#8211; I was nervous at first, but once we got into the swing of things, it went smoothly. The biggest issue was making sure that there was always someone &#8220;off&#8221; to keep an eye on our gear so that it didn&#8217;t walk away. And it was super helpful to rotate through the photogs in such a way that someone was always available to assist. As you can see here:

There was quite a variety in the looks of our models. The first person I shot was <a href="http://jennbollenbacher.com" target="_blank">Jenn</a>, who was going for a &#8220;college student/social media junkie&#8221; theme.

    Intensity, defined. I really love the crisp contrast of the white letters against the blue

Another model was Phia, who went in a different direction&#8230;much more vintage.

<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mugsy/4522454426/in/set-72157623688278635"><img title="Phia" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4021/4522454426_92e22f5328.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    So I go a little overboard with Lightroom post-processing. It's okay...because it matches the theme, right?
  </p>
</div>

I also did some portraits of Allie, although I never did shoot Jess (who was our third model). Things got a little confusing. But this is proof that even photographers can make great subjects!

<div style="width: 343px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mugsy/4521856085/in/set-72157623688278635"><img title="Allie" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4015/4521856085_26cda920ec.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="500" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

Overall, this was quite a fun shoot, and I can&#8217;t wait to try it again. I highly recommend checking out the rest of the group&#8217;s shots <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1397784@N23/pool/" target="_blank">here</a> &#8211; one of my very favorites is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/louisparks/4468518620/in/pool-1397784@N23" target="_blank">this one</a> of Phia that Louis shot. It&#8217;s really quite incredible.
