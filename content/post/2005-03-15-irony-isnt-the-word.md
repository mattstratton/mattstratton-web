So I went out for drinks tonight with this girl who replied to my ad on Craigslist.

She seemed nice enough in emails, plus, she has a cute dog.

Anyway, her name is Kelly&#8230;and she looks \*exactly\* like [**Kelly Belmont**][1].

That was kind of weird. Not bad, because she&#8217;s very cute, but it&#8217;s kind of hard to be on a date with a girl who completely reminds you of your lesbian friend.
