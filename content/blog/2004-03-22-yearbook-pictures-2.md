So I was talking to today about _A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream_, so I sent her this picture of me when I appeared in the play in 1991.

And I decided I should post the other yearbook picture flashbacks I&#8217;ve got. Since some of you have never seen them.

**My freshman year in high school. Taken in the fall of 1989.**

**Me playing &#8220;Uncle John&#8221; in _The Grapes of Wrath_ in Feburary, 1992.**

**More from _Grapes._**

**The climactic scene of _Grapes of Wrath_. I end up falling into the &#8220;river&#8221; right after this.**

**This is taken in May of 1992, when I appeared in _Plaza Suite_.**

**Another picture from _Plaza Suite_.**

**Homecoming 1992**

**My senior year on Speech Team. Taken in January 1993.**
