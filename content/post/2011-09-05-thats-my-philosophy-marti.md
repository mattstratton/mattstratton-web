The <a href="http://www.purekatherine.com/2011/09/welcome-to-beds/" target="_blank">BEDS</a> prompt for today is to share a &#8220;favorite quote&#8221;. Now, given that it is Labor Day, it seems only appropriate to share a quotation (quote is a verb, quotation is a noun) that is inspirational.

I am not going to do that. I am totally rebellous* like that.

My quotation comes from the philosopher Phillip J. Fry:

&#8220;I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called _Three&#8217;s Company_.&#8221;

Interesting sidenote &#8211; in the effort of making sure I got this exactly right, I found out on the Googles that I&#8217;ve been misquoting it for years. Almost every online bio I have includes the phrase &#8220;I learned everything I know about sticky social situations from a little show called _Three&#8217;s Company_.&#8221;

Whoops.

* &#8211; this is an inside joke that only my wife&#8217;s family will get. It&#8217;s like being a hipster, but with less PBR

_Bonus points if you can identify the quotation of the title_
