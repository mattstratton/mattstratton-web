So basically, learned nothing at the re-org conference call. As FJ said &#8220;I actually feel dumber having participated in that call.&#8221;

I love Cake. I also love cake.

Camping this past weekend was awesome. Hopefully there&#8217;ll be some pictures up soon. Special thanks to for turning it into &#8220;sexual innuendo camping&#8221;. Because he&#8217;s got a poker and knows how to get wood.

Two weeks until [Y7A][1]. I&#8217;m teaching a [rocking improv class][2] there too. So if you&#8217;re around you you should totally sign up for it. And by &#8220;around&#8221; I mean &#8220;in New York on Oct 1&#8221;.

I had some more to say but I forgot what it was. it probably was about Trapper though, because, well, we should all be talking about Trapper.

I hope Brian posts in his blog today. That would make it a better Monday. Not a [Happy Monday][3], but a better Monday.
