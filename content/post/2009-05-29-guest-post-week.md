June 1 &#8211; 5 is Guest Post Week here at Good Old Rock. What does that mean? It means for five days in a row, you won&#8217;t have to read MY words&#8230;but instead, you&#8217;ll be treated to a variety of posts by a bunch of bloggers who I think are pretty awesome. Here&#8217;s the schedule:

_Monday_ &#8211; **Christina** of <a href="http://stackedblog.com" target="_blank">Stacked</a> will be reviewing a book about photographing unicorns. No, I am not making this up. Yes, it will be hilarious.

_Tuesday_ &#8211; My wife, **Carrie**, will post on the topic of what it is like to be married to me. She also made me promise to not read it until it is posted. I&#8217;m actually a little scared.

_Wednesday_ &#8211; **Pamela** ofÂ <a href="http://deritisdaily.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Conversations: Pamela One-on-One</a> shares with us the perspective of a model in photography. I&#8217;m pretty excited about this one, as I&#8217;m always the one taking the pictures&#8230;nobody ever takes pictures of me. This is for a good reason.

_Thursday_ &#8211; It&#8217;s finally time for the iPhone Twitter App Shoot-Out&#8230;which comes to us courtesy of **Marcelo**. My <a href="/2009/02/19/blackberry-twitter-client-shoot-out/" target="_self">post about BlackBerry Twitter apps</a> is one of the most popular ones I&#8217;ve ever written, but I suppose the iPhone is popular enough now to warrant its own shoot-out as well.

_Friday_ &#8211; Wrapping up the week, **Tiffany** of <a href="http://confessionsofachicagogirl.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Confessions of a Chicago Girl</a> has something special for us. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but I know it&#8217;s tech-related. Stay tuned!
