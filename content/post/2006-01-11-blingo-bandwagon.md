I&#8217;m fairly sure I posted about this a while ago, but I just won another prize with [Blingo][1], so I figured it was time to share the love yet again.

<span class="postbody"><a href="http://www.blingo.com/friends?ref=GrMwkHyWL7sj8ze0i21U_iJxih0" target="_blank" class="postlink">Blingo.com</a> is a Google-powered search engine that randomly gives people prizes (mostly free movie tickets and iTunes gift certificates, though also Visa gift cards and iPods) for using their search engine. It works exactly like Google and gives the same results, but every time I use it, I get to think &#8220;Will I win an iPod for looking this up?&#8221; I put it in my Firefox toolbar instead of Google, so now when I&#8217;m using Firefox, there&#8217;s a convenient Blingo search field built into every window. I&#8217;m a sucker, but it&#8217;s still fun. It&#8217;s like playing the lottery without paying for tickets.</p>

  Check it <a href="http://www.blingo.com/friends?ref=GrMwkHyWL7sj8ze0i21U_iJxih0" target="_blank" class="postlink">out</a>.

  You heard it here first!
</p>

<p>
  Plus, it gives you another company who can track everything you do on teh intarwebs, which is always good, right? In all seriousness, </span><span class="postbody">I looked at this for quite a while before trying it out, and especially before sharing it with you all. I think it&#8217;s pretty tight. I&#8217;ve been using it for quite a while, and haven&#8217;t freaked out about it. In fact, I&#8217;ve even spoken on the phone with the creator (he wanted to see if I&#8217;d be willing to talk to a reporter or two for an interview).</p>

    I&#8217;ve won two iTunes gift certificates via Blingo. No iPod yet though.<br /> </span>
