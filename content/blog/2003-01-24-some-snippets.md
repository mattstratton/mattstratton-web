&#8230;from various reviews of _Inventing: Music_ on [Triggerstreet.com][1]

&#8220;A quietly funny little film that sneaks up on you and leaves you laughing out loud in places.&#8221;

&#8220;A well thought out, well acted short which shows a lot of promise for these filmmakers.&#8221;

&#8220;Ryan Peterson is excellent, teetering on that excruciating edge&#8230;body language and delivery of lines gave me shivers.&#8221;

&#8220;Bill Henderson should run for president.&#8221;

&#8220;Great concept and modernization of why we guys can&#8217;t impress the ladies, no matter how much we lie about ourselves.&#8221;
