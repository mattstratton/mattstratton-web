I&#8217;m really tired right now and did not have a great day (car died on the Eisenhower and Scout and I had to wait for a tow truck by the side of the road) but I did want to let you all know that:

1) We have been completely approved for our loan (and a quarter of a percent lower on the interest rate than we&#8217;d thought) and
  
2) We close on our house a WEEK FROM TOMORROW

We still won&#8217;t be moving until the end of Sept, but man oh man, this is just crazygonuts.

More later when I have the energy.
