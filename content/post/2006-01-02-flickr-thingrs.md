Couple cool tools for use with the Flickr online photo sharing site:

[quickr pickr][1] &#8211; useful for blogging your Flickr photos, especially when you want to post more than one image at a time (the &#8220;Blog This&#8221; button only supports one image at a time)

[Flickr Importr][2] &#8211; third-party upload tool for Windows that provides a lot more flexibility towards tagging, etc (I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but it sounds like it works a lot like the iPhoto Flickr plugin)
