First of all, I&#8217;m sorry for STILL no blog post about the honeymoon. I swear, it is coming. We kept a paper journal and everything. But, um, we&#8217;re waiting until we get the pictures from our disposable camera developed. Yeah, that&#8217;s the ticket.

Other things&#8230;

Friday night, Carrie and I were considering going to Summerdance, but after talking to Lou at lunch, we decided to go to Taste of Randolph instead. We headed down there, and paid our $10 each &#8220;suggested donation&#8221; to enter. There we were met by a faulty ATM, lots of annoying River North types, and lines of at least 30 people for EVERY food vendor. And don&#8217;t even ask about the drink ticket/beer line; I swear it was about three blocks long.

We stopped by the Big City Swing booth and chatted with Lou and Julee for a few minutes, got frustrated with the crowd, and went home. We had dinner at Sticky Rice (a place we&#8217;ve driven by loads of times, but never went in). It was really, really good. The food was tasty and super cheap, and the bright and sunny interior perked us right up.

On Saturday we returned some things to Bed Bath and Beyond, and cashed in a lot of gift cards in order to purchase our pots and pans. We got a nice set of Calphalon that we&#8217;re excited about. I would tell you more specifics, but I am getting tired of people second-guessing every decision I make, so if you really want to see our pots, please come visit :)

Saturday night we had a two-fer of parties &#8211; Carrie&#8217;s friend Jayme had a housewarming at her new condo, and then we attended a going-away party for Nathan (who is going to work in Australia for four months). Had fun playing beanbags at Jayme&#8217;s (and some crazy good appetizers), and then at the going-away party had my first &#8220;professional&#8221; flippy-cup experience (they called it &#8220;flip cup&#8221;, but I know that&#8217;s wrong). I turned out to be quite good at it, although my team lost almost every single round because ONE dude on our team was really bad. But we had fun.

On Sunday we took Scout to the park for a while and let him run. Then we met Ellie and Kevin (and Kate) for lunch in Lincoln Square. From there, we headed out to suburbia for Fathers Day. On&nbsp; the way, we stopped at Crate and Barrel to cash in gift cards and get our knives. They are Wusthof. We like them. Although they look very lonely (the block they came in has a lot of blanks!)

Fathers Day dinner was at my mom&#8217;s house, and then we all trucked out to Lisle to have dinner at my sister&#8217;s new condo. It&#8217;s pretty sweet. She has a big balcony that looks out over the forest. Carrie and I are looking forward to visiting her in the winter and using the sled hill.

So yes. That is the exciting life of the married couple. Sadly, I think that if you combine our newfound irritation with street fairs with us seeming to only hang out with each other with our new SUV, it all points to the fact that this time next year we&#8217;ll be living in the suburbs.

Adios, City Matt!
