&#8230;of being fat.

I went clothes shopping today with Boyband, and I swear, I am a huge blobby mess of blech.

I need to lose about 2 inches off of my waist, and my entire gut needs to disappear.

The good news is, I joined a new gym that is right accross the street from my office. I am going to make myself go every single day. I must stay motivated! There&#8217;s no reason for me to be so damn pudgy.

I&#8217;m sure it would help with the ladieth as well, if I didn&#8217;t look like I was four months pregnant all the time.
