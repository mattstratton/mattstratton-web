My mom sent this email the other day:

_I think that it is already  time for Cubs fans to start the perennial chant._

_Kind of reminds me of when I was kid (in the Ernie Banks, Billie Williams, Ron Santo, et. al.) days and my father would bite on this pipe and lament that &#8220;if the Cubs could only get some pitching&#8221;._ 

_And, for Becky and Debbie who may not have heard the latest Cubs news, Kerry Wood is out for 5 or 6 weeks.  Can you throw a baseball 60 feet?
  
_ 
  
My uncle then sent the following reply:

_Yea, but not in one toss anymore._
