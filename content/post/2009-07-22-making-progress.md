Things are progressing nicely with my fitness/weight loss program. I am into Week 4 of Couch to 5K and have been eating reasonably for a few weeks as well. I&#8217;ve also been educating myself and reading a lot of nutrition literature &#8211; as well as a lot of really useful comments I got from you, my loyal readers in reply to my [last post][1].

Weight-wise, I&#8217;m trending well. As you may recall, when I started this journey, I was at 238 pounds. After going Up North for Memorial Day, I hit a high of 243 pounds. Well, as of this week, I am down to 233 pounds &#8211; **a net loss of 5 pounds, but ten pounds since July 6**! Here&#8217;s a nice chart to show that (although it seems to be missing the 238 weigh-in):

<div id="attachment_5461" style="width: 537px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/spark-weight.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5461" title="spark-weight" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/spark-weight.png" alt="I have no idea what &quot;goal line&quot; is trending from" width="527" height="249" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/spark-weight.png 527w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/07/spark-weight-300x141.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    I have no idea what "goal line" is trending from
  </p>
</div>

I know that the scale is not the best metric to use, and I am planning to switch to waist inch measuring starting next Monday. So a new report will be coming in a while too.

Now, as to my fitness&#8230;as I mentioned, I&#8217;m on Week 4 of my program. Yesterday was the first day I ran that program, and it was tough &#8211; first time I had five minute run intervals, and the first time that the time running exceeded walking. That being said, I felt good while going through the workout, and tomorrow morning should be easier than yesterday was. Next week will be the real challenge; the last workout of Week 5 includes a 20 minute run! My pace generally improves every run as well, which I think is a good thing. One definite improvement &#8211; last week I went to <a href="https://www.runningcompany.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Naperville Running Company</strong></a>, and got new running shoes that were properly fitted to my feet&#8230;plus shoes that were the right kind for how I run and what my foot type is. This has made a HUGE difference &#8211; I feel much better after every run since I got my new shoes!

All in all, things are going at a great pace (no pun intended). My goal is to run a 5K by September &#8211; although the <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=a3MxNmIxNzA5MGJsdnNzaDdpa2NtMzBlZ2sgN3E0cmJrcDE3cThnMmtmNzgwZDJmcDlpOThAZw&ctz=America/Chicago" target="_blank">race that I want to run</a> is actually an 8K! We&#8217;ll see if I can make that. I&#8217;ll never know if I don&#8217;t try.
