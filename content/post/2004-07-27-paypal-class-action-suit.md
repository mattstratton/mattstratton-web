Did any of you guys get an email about this?

<a href="https://www.paypal.com/settlement" target="_blank">https://www.paypal.com/settlement</a>

It doesn&#8217;t appear to be a phisher thing, because they never asked for a password or anything else like that. And the link is direct on Paypal.

Just curious.
