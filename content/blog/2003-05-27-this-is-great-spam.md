Even better than the one from CarrotFucking.com&#8230;I just got this pornspam today:

_Hey, wuzzup?! remember me? I&#8217;m Crystal. I&#8217;m 23 and I work in the lawn care area of Lowe&#8217;s.I really wantna to meet you and I thought this would be the best way to let you no I really wanna get together withyou so I sent you these pictures (i stole my cheerleading unifrom from when I was in highschool and i kept it!). I have more pic my profile at Guaranteed Date but I couldn&#8217;t send them because they are pretty raunchy andI didn&#8217;t want yu to get in trouble if you see them at work :)) Anyways, you can look at the pictures of me and if you want we can get together when I&#8217;m not at work. My son has daycare all day and his father takes him on theweekends and some nights so I have the trailer all to myself whenever we need it. Plus I have my own truck so I can drive to you or whatever.</p> 

XOXOXOXO CandyCrystal\***</i>

That&#8217;s the best thing ever.
