I just woke up from a nap with some really vivid dreams.

The funny part was, during this one, I several times convinced myself that I was \*not\* dreaming, because it was &#8220;too real&#8221;. Even though it was ridiculous.

At one point I was at a diner, or restaurant of some kind, with Amy W, Lindyphil, and someone else (I don&#8217;t remember who now). I ordered a turkey sandwich, and after eating half of it, noticed it was not turkey, but brisket. I pointed this out to the waitress, but she kind of shrugged it off.

After that, there was some kind of a fight &#8211; a squad car drove off, with a waitress chasing out the door of the diner shouting &#8220;Where&#8217;s my tip, assholes?!&#8221;. Then the Greek owner came out and yelled after the cops. Suddenly, random girls were throwing punches at some guys. Weird.

Then I logged onto my laptop, and saw that on LJ there were a bunch of posts on &#8216;s journal with pictures of me. Something broke with my IM, and I woke up.
