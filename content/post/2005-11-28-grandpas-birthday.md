Got this email just now from my mom. Some of you may remember me talking about my grandpa during the Cubs playoff run in 2003 (that is, I talked about him them&#8230;he wasn&#8217;t alive at the time).

_Dear Matt, Becky, Debbie, David, Daniel, Anya and Chaya,</p> 

Today would have been your grandfather&#8217;s 84th birthday, so if you find yourself feeling a warm glow inside maybe it&#8217;s because you are thinking of him.

One of the few things in life that saddens me is that perhaps Matt is his only grandchild to have seen a little of who he really was. But, if you ever find yourself cheering for the &#8220;underdog&#8221;, that&#8217;s his influence. If you ever find yourself volunteering to help an organization just because the help is needed and with no expectation or desire for applause or grandeur, that&#8217;s him, too. If you find yourself turning off lights to save money on the electricity, blame him also.

He had many sayings that, while I can&#8217;t recall many now, come to me at the appropriate time. But, when you find yourself &#8220;trusting him/her as far as I can throw an elephant&#8221; or thinking that &#8220;there is a place for everything and everything in its place&#8221;, know that it&#8217;s just him. However, the one that we heard often (and now I find myself trying to live by) is that &#8220;actions speak louder than words.&#8221;

Perhaps his greatest legacy should be the lesson of determination. He could be accused of being stubborn (and I remember his parents arguing over which one of them came from the more stubborn family so I guess he was doomed) but in his case it was manifested in his determination. His was a determination to overcome whatever obstacle was in his path&#8211;the final one being Parkinson&#8217;s. Not long before he died, he was at our house doing what he could for exercises and I overheard him telling Becky and/or Debbie that &#8220;if they ever come up with a cure for this thing, I&#8217;m going to ready&#8221;.

So, Happy Birthday, Grandpa. Some of us can remember that on our birthdays, he would call and greet us with his &#8220;Irish tenor&#8221; rendition of the birthday song, so maybe sing to him today.

With love,

Mom/Aunt Phyllis</i>
