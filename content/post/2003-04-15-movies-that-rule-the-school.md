Two new DVD&#8217;s coming out [this week][1]:

**&#8220;Beat Street&#8221;** (1984). Directed by Stan Lathan. Starring Guy Davis, Rae Dawn Chong (MGM). At the time, it was the greatest hip-hop film ever made.

**&#8220;Breakin&#8217; 2: Electric Boogaloo&#8221;**(1984). Directed by Sam Firstenberg. Starring Lucinda Dickey, Adolfo &#8220;Shabba Doo&#8221; Quinones, Michael &#8220;Boogaloo Shrimp&#8221; Chambers (MGM). Perennial fave of drive-in movie critic Joe Bob Briggs. Must be seen to be believed.
