When we first decided to move to the suburbs, we made a lot of jokes about how we were going to have to do things like buy a trampoline to get our city friends to come visit us. Someone even honestly warned us that once we moved, nobody would ever want to come see us way out "in the country". We laughed and joked along.

Joke&#8217;s over, it seems.

I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that I&nbsp;probably haven&#8217;t done much in the way of reaching out to my friends back in the city. So maybe it&#8217;s my fault. But I&nbsp;can&#8217;t help but feel that since we left, we&#8217;ve been forgotten about. Carrie&#8217;s friends actually do make an effort to include her even though we live out in the middle of nowhere. They&#8217;ve even come to see our house. But for me, the only friends of mine that I&#8217;ve seen since we&#8217;ve moved are the ones who already live in the suburbs.

I&#8217;m doing a bad job of adjusting to this. Once the adjustment is complete, it&#8217;ll be fine. I&nbsp;was hoping that when we moved out here, I&#8217;d be able to reconnect with my old friends who live in the suburbs. But I haven&#8217;t done that. I seem to have lost my friends from the city. And my other friends all live in different towns now and&nbsp;we can&#8217;t afford to go see them.

I&#8217;m feeling sorry for myself, I&nbsp;know. And I have no right to &#8211; I&nbsp;have a great job,&nbsp; a great house, a great wife, and a great dog. And anyone who knows me knows that I&nbsp;don&#8217;t deal with transitions well, but once they are over, I do manage to land on my feet.

But right now it just feels full of suck.
