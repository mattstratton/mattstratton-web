Time for some various and sundry updates.

**The Pupperoni**
  
Carrie and I are experiencing a Scout-less weekend, since he went Up North with Carrie&#8217;s sister Becky yesterday to visit the grandparents. He&#8217;ll be back on Monday. Our house is very quiet. Also, we finally got a full night&#8217;s sleep last night &#8211; since we&#8217;ve been having t-storms overnight the past few days, Scout has been a wreck and insisting on sleeping in our bed&#8230;ON TOP of us, no less. He&#8217;s kind of a freak.

**Work-O-Rama**
  
We had a new contractor start with us on Monday. Since my team lead is on vacation for another week, I have been Acting Team Lead, which is less exciting then it sounds. Unfortunately, this has been a VERY slow week here at work, so I&#8217;ve had nothing to do. And since the first two days the new guy didn&#8217;t have a computer yet, he spent the entire day in my cube looking over my shoulder watching me &#8220;work&#8221;. So I got really behind in my blog reading.

**School**
  
I took some time off this summer from school (due to the wedding, honeymoon, etc), but on Monday I start up again. I only have one class this term, which is Environmental Science.

**Money Talks**
  
Now that the wedding is over, Carrie and I are starting to really sit down and put some plans in place to get ready to buy a house. We sat down the other night and worked through our budget and revised savings plan. So for the next few months (at least), we are buckling down on spending &#8211; so don&#8217;t be surprised if we suddenly become really boring people who don&#8217;t spend money on anything (as opposed to the &#8220;really boring people who spend money on lots of things&#8221; that we already were).

Fun and Games**
  
Tomorrow, Carrie and I are driving down to Kankakee to go on a canoeing day trip. Looks like the weather should be perfect for it. We&#8217;re also hoping to go Up North over Labor Day weekend &#8211; and of course, to celebrate Brian&#8217;s birthday with him in suburban style next Saturday.

So I guess that was not the most thrilling entry of all time. I&#8217;m really bored at work and the sandwich I had for lunch is making me sleepy.
