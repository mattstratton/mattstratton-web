This one chick on Yehoodi is shilling for votes for a story she wrote. I thought it was hilarious (the story, not the shilling), so I&#8217;m posting the link here so you guys can all vote too.

> Two summers ago I had a sureal NYC experience that I turned into a story and recently entered in an online writing contest. Anyway, I was trucking along at first place when suddenly someone else entered and started racking up points too!
> 
> Anyway, visit http://tribeca.net/home/comma/native-new-yorker (Direct link to my entry).
> 
> On the righthand side of the screen will be an orange button marked &#8220;VOTE&#8221; Click there, register (it&#8217;s quick) and vote for me! The higher the ranking the better I do.
> 
> Need encouragement? It&#8217;s a true story involving me, four strangers, a cockroach, and dropping my pants in the subway.
> 
> If I will, I&#8217;ll come back and thank the little people! And if you vote, I&#8217;ll act the story out for you..much more entertaining. 

The picture posted here is the story&#8217;s author &#8211; I don&#8217;t think it has anything to do with cockroaches, though.
