Next weekend, Scout, Carrie, and I will be walking in the [Bark in the Park][1] event here in Chicago.

No, it&#8217;s not a marathon. No, it&#8217;s not the AIDS Walk or the Breast-a-Thon. But I still think it&#8217;s important. And if you think it&#8217;s important too, please donate to the Anti-Cruelty Society via my webpage at <http://www.firstgiving.com/mattstratton>.
