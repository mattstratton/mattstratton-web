Last night went to the Cubs/Pirates game with Rak, Lippy, Julia, and Erika. Oh, and Chiv, who is visiting from NYC this week.

The weather was pretty good &#8211; not too chilly, and when it did rain a bit in the 8th inning, we were far enough under the upper deck that it didn&#8217;t affect us at all. The game was so-so; the Lemont Little League team sang the stretch, and I could just imagine their coach up there with them saying &#8220;guys, remember when I told you not to do that? And THAT?&#8221;

Yeah, they suck.

Had a good ride into work this morning. Forgot to pack a belt, so my pants, which are too big for me right now, keep falling down. Good thing I packed a lunch, so I don&#8217;t have a lot of places to walk to today.
