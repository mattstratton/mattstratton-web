I guess I&#8217;m going to Los Angeles in two weeks.

&nbsp;and &nbsp;are having &#8220;teh partay&#8221;, to celebrate the fact that Marcelo has gone another year without someone killing him, and that Drew (or should that be &#8220;Teh Drew&#8221;) moved in. In a sleep-deprived haze, I agreed to forgo ATLX (anyone want to buy a registration?) and instead visit the&nbsp;wretched hive of scum and villany that is LA. Plus, &nbsp;is going. And . And if all is right with the world, .

So I booked my flight. I will be arriving on Friday, April 1. I head home on Tuesday night, and get home at like 5 AM&#8230;so, as Amanda said, I will &#8220;sleep on the plane and then go right to work&#8221;. Yeah. This makes a lot of fucking sense.But I bet it&#8217;ll be a blast.
