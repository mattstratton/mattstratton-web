I&#8217;m posting this late, but I did take the picture last week, so it totally counts!

[<img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3599/3310839540_f520ac796d.jpg" alt="Week 8/52" width="500" height="500" />][1]{.tt-flickr.tt-flickr-Medium}

This photo was taken on the beach in Ft. Lauderdale. Surprise, surprise, I used the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007U00X0?ie=UTF8&tag=straigeyefort-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0007U00X0" target="_blank">Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6</a> for this shot. I brought it into Photoshop and created two duplicate layers (for a total of three). I desaturated the middle layer, and then set the top layer to &#8220;hard light&#8221;. The top layer was set to 100% opacity, but the middle (desaturated) layer was 50%. I then merged the layers and applied noise (6% Gaussian).
