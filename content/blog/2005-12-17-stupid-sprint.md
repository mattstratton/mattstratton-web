So I got a new phone today, since my old one was pretty beat up.

I decided to get the LG PM-325, since it looked kind of cool, wasn&#8217;t that expensive, and was the only phone (besides the Treo) that had Bluetooth. I figured that a wireless handset would come in handy, but mostly I wanted to be able to sync it with the address book on my Mac.

Well, I come to discover that stupid fucking Sprint doesn&#8217;t enable the ability to sync with address books on their Bluetooth phones. How friggin&#8217; annoying.
