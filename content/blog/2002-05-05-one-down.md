Day one has been completed. We&#8217;ve finished the first day of shooting.

I finally feel comfortable calling myself a filmmaker now.

One of the pieces of advice everyone gives to a bride and groom is to &#8220;take some time to remember this day.&#8221; They tell you to just sit back during the hubbub and drink in th experience. I wanted to do that yesterday.

But I didn&#8217;t get much chance.

About the only thing that I do have burned into my head is the cheesy work mix of &#8220;Wade in the Water&#8221; that we were using for onset sound (we&#8217;re looping our &#8220;real&#8221; version in post).

We had quite a few extras bail on us; this ended up being okay though. My DP, Ben, was able to pull off the reaction shots that we needed.

I think my actors got their first hint of how much of a movie set is &#8220;hurry up and wait.&#8221; I am especially proud of Fuzzy. Not only did he really breathe some life into his character (Dallas and I both have always maintained that he may steal this film away), but he really did a hell of a job of hanging tough through 45 minutes of lighting/camera setup for his interview.

Today we&#8217;re shooting the barbeque scene. I&#8217;ll journal some more when I get home.
