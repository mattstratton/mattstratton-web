Jeff just called me. He&#8217;s got the Cubs tickets from his work for today. You know. Opening Day.

This necessitated the following IM conversation:

**Matt:** I know the rule is to request days off in advance, but I just came down with &#8220;opening day cough&#8221;
  
**Matt&#8217;s Boss:** lol
  
**Matt:** (translation &#8211; a ticket for today&#8217;s game just dropped in my lap)
  
**Matt&#8217;s Boss:** that fine
  
**Matt&#8217;s Boss:** you lucky I am a cubs fan buddy
  
**Matt:** that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re the best boss ever
  
**Matt:** :)

Gonna need to bundle up though. And I guess this means that I start South Beach tomorrow instead of today.
