For those of you who don&#8217;t know, my friends Lou and Julee just kicked off an around-the-world trip. They have posted their first updates on [Lou&#8217;s blog][1], and it&#8217;s really funny (and interesting). My favorite:
  


> In the afternoon we joined up with a group tour to the Sumo Arena. Not knowing the etiquette, Julee was very concerned that we would be undressed for the sumo match so we asked the concierge if jeans were ok. To this he jokingly replied, “People there to watch sumo, not you.”</p>
I highly recommend you guys keep an eye on Loupy.com. I think that the two of them have a fine career as travelogue writers.
