The [BEDS][1] prompt for today is &#8220;include a photo of yourself taken over ten years ago&#8221;.

[<img class="alignnone size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/20110910-070355.jpg" alt="20110910-070355.jpg" width="461" height="307" />][2]

This picture was taken almost 19 years ago &#8211; Halloween of 1992. My camp counselor friends and I dressed in our Renaissance costumes and went trick-or-treating in Naperville (a suburb of Chicago). We actually did a little show at every house.

We were nerds.
