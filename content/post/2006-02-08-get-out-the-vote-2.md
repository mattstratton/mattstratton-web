Have you <u>**[voted][1]**</u> for &#8220;Sucker For Dames&#8221; yet? If not, go do it now! And tell your friends! We must win this. WE MUST!

And by &#8220;we&#8221;, I of course mean and . And the rest of us who have been canvassing the webbernets ruslting up votes.

DO IT. Do it now.

It&#8217;s the right thing to do, and a tasty way to do it.
