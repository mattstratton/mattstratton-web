I know, I know, I haven&#8217;t posted since Friday. But, in my defense, I was on vacation. And yes, I got back yesterday, but I had a lot to do &#8211; I had to go to the Bulls game with a vendor. Plus, today I had to go to work, and that took some getting used to. 

I promise, I&#8217;ll have some more content very very soon. I fully intend to spool up a few posts tomorrow &#8211; although my internets will be down for a while, as we are getting U-Verse installed tomorrow morning. But I should have something to post by the afternoon. I&#8217;m actually planning to put up a fairly nerd-tastic post about what I&#8217;ve learned (so far) about cloud computing (I&#8217;ve been at Microsoft twice in the last seven days attending presentations and roundtables on the subject). So save up all your cloudy questions for tomorrow!

In the meantime, here&#8217;s a picture from our vacation. The rest will be up soon.
