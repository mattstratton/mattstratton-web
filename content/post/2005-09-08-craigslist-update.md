Nothing new to report with the other Craigslist girls&#8230;they all kind of fell off the email chain.

I replied to this ad today though. She seems pretty up my alley, although probably a little out of my league and a little too rock-and-roll for me.

_very skeptical i&#8217;ll find the man of my dreams here, but hey it can&#8217;t be any worse than getting picked up at a bar. anyways as the title says i am a serious movie buff and love talking about all things regarding cinema. some of my favorite movies: forrest gump, pulp fiction, amadeus, lord of the rings, the matrix, casablanca, annie hall, boogie nights, amelie, talk to her, before sunset, bad santa, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, about a boy, crouching tiger hidden dragon._ 

_i make a great companion to the movies, and someone to snuggle up with at home when watching a dvd. i also enjoy travelling to europe and asia and have visited over 12 countries in my lifetime. my ideal guy would be artsy, cool, funny, intelligent, mature, adventurous, and honest._ 

 _i am NOT interested in NSA sex, cheating husbands, and business men from out of town._ 

 _men who have dogs, tats, piercings, spikey hair, confidence, and don&#8217;t live with their parents turn me on._ 

 _men who are greedy, overly cocky, man-spirited, petty, or shy turn me off._ 

 _i am 5&#8217;4&#8243; average body, 1 tattoo on my lower hip, 4 piercings (nose, ears, and a discreet location for you to find out), and drug free._ 

 _write me and let&#8217;s figure out what to see next!_
