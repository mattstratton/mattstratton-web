wrote me a testimonial&#8230;

&#8220;Mugsy is a big pushover. You can get him to do just about anything if you whine long enough. This comes in handy more often than you think, gals. He&#8217;s also a bartender, so you can brag to your friends&#8230;and he&#8217;ll make you free drinks. Well, if he weren&#8217;t a bartender, he&#8217;d buy you drinks anyway because he&#8217;s just that type of guy. But you get my jist. So, anyway, date Mugsy. Because then he&#8217;ll stop making comments about my rack. Oh, and he&#8217;s smart and funny and all that other stuff too.&#8221; &#8211;Shana Worel, Hopeful Friend and Experienced Pushoverer.

I need less mean friends :)
