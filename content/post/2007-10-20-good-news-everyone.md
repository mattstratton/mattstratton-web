I actually mean that too &#8211; not in a Farnsworth way.

This post is f-locked for obvious reasons. Anyway, I got a great phone call yesterday on the L on the way to the airport: I got a new job!

Starting two weeks from Monday, I will be the new Manager of IT Operations for a company that will be named later (I don&#8217;t want to say it until I start, but it&#8217;s an online company based in Chicago). It&#8217;s a significant pay bump, plus more responsibility. I will be giving my notice on Monday morning. Here&#8217;s hoping my boss doesn&#8217;t stick me with the &#8220;all people with VP title must give four weeks notice&#8221; crap.

Carrie and I are in NYC for the weekend. We&#8217;re very excited about everything.
