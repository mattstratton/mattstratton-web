_Using your LJ if you had one, and your memory if you didn&#8217;t, tell me where you were on this day&#8230;</p> 

a &#8211; 3 years ago
  
b &#8211; 2 years ago
  
c &#8211; 1 year ago

If you can, say where geographically you were, what was going on that day, what was going on in your life, anything that had recently happened, etc.

Then

d &#8211; write about where you are now

a &#8211; Three years ago, it was a few days before I got laid off from GE. I was just finishing up shooting Dancing With Gaia. I lived at Clark and Wellington with Susanna and Kristin. Good times. I was single.

b &#8211; Two years ago I was living up on Artesian upstairs from Sarah and Chris. I was working at Allstate (about to leave and start the job with AON actually). I was single (but I had gone on a date the night before with this girl Kim).

c &#8211; One year ago I was visiting who was in Philly for a business trip. We had gone to Atlantic City the night before. Fun times. I lived in my current apartment. I was single.

d &#8211; I am in Brooklyn right now, at &#8216;s house. Going to go see the Cubs play at Yankee stadium tonight. I live at Wellington and Sheffield. I am single.
