So I&#8217;m doing my last minute packing, and tomorrow morning I&#8217;m off to Rochester for the <a href="http://www.rochesterfilmfest.org" target="_blank">Rochester International Film Festival</a>.

If any of you are in the area, please stop by for our 8 PM screening on Saturday. We&#8217;d love to see you there!

Otherwise, I have no idea what my interweb access is going to be like this weekend, so I may or may not be getting to email and LJ. So feel free to post all sorts of wacky shit, because I won&#8217;t see it. Unless has wifi.

See you all next week!
