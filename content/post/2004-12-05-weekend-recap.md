This was a very fun weekend, and I&#8217;m not even 30 yet!

Last night went out for KMP&#8217;s birthday (his \*actual\* 30th). Great pizza and an awesome DJ at Smart Bar. Had a good time and lots of drinks.

My new closet came crashing down at 5 am today, scaring the shit out of me. Loupy is coming over on Wednesday to help me try to fix it.

I really enjoyed my party. A lot. And especially my gift. I found it interesting who showed up, who helped, and who blew it off. But even though my default reaction is to feel shitty that people blew off the party, the fact that my real and true friends did so much amazing stuff for me more than makes up for it.

It&#8217;s been a weekend of a lot of reflection. I had a long conversation with Kim on Saturday, and she opened my eyes to a lot of things to reflect on. I had some friendships reaffirmed, and other relationships exposed. All in all, it&#8217;s been an interesting weekend.

But either way, I finally have a home to be proud of. And that still touches me in a way I cannot describe.
