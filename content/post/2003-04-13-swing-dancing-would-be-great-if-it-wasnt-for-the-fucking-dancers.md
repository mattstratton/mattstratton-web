Ah, once again, swing dancers [acting like morons][1].

To quote Dave Barry, I am not making this up.

_&#8220;But my issue is this: I&#8217;ve thought myself before that I really should concentrate on improving my dancing before I take it all over the country. I&#8217;ve gotten sucked into this great exchange thing, but should a person be at a certain skill level before they really get into that?&#8221;_

Gawd, I hate swing dancers.
