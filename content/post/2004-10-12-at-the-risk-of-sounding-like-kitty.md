I have Moby&#8217;s blog on a feed into my friends page. Sometimes it is interesting. Occasionally it makes me chuckle, like this entry did today:

_i like seasons as verbs.
  
we summer in davos.
  
we winter in golfe juan.
  
and where do we spring and fall?
  
while trampolining drunkenly?_

For some reason it was reminiscent of to me. I don&#8217;t know why.
