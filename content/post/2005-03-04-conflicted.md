I was looking forward to being able to post today about how I was so excited&#8230;I managed to finally get my tickets for the Cubs vs. Yankees game at Yankee Stadium in June.

Of course, shortly after acquiring said tickets (which included paying with one of my kidneys, basically), I found out that it is the same weekend as a going-away party for two of my dearest friends here in Chicago.

I&#8217;m really torn here. And I know some of you won&#8217;t understand why I have a conflict; I suppose to most people it&#8217;s a no-brainer &#8211; don&#8217;t pick baseball over your friends. But this is a Really Big Deal. The Cubs have only played at Yankee Stadium twice, in the 1932 and 1938 World Series. I saw the Cubs battle the Yanks at Wrigley in 2003 (incidentally, I saw that game with one of the people whose party it is that I would be missing &#8211; which is how I found out about the conflict; I asked him if he wanted to try to go to one of the games with me).

I think part of the importance of this game for me is that it&#8217;s also symbolic &#8211; this is probably the last summer I&#8217;ll be living in Chicago for at least a while. It&#8217;s my last summer to be a &#8220;local&#8221; Cubs fan. And I&#8217;m moving to New York. So Cubs/Yankees kind of symbolizes me (although I&#8217;ll never be a Yankees fan, !)

It&#8217;s possible that I could maybe miss the Sunday game, and fly home after the Saturday afternoon game and still make the party. I think I am going to try really hard to make that happen. Except that Sunday would be the day I would be going with my friend who works for MLB (if we can get those tickets; Sunday is still not confirmed).

Maybe that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do.
