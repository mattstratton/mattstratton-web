Man, there are NO jobs out there.

All the stuff I see is either out in the suburbs (which I can&#8217;t do because I have no car), or it is a listing with Remington or Boyleston or another one of those body-shops that has never ever come through for me (or anyone else I know; how do these places stay in business? I don&#8217;t know a single person who has ever gotten a job through them).

It&#8217;s frustrating. I need a job. I don&#8217;t much care what it is. Although taking a low-paying job is going to put the movie stuff on hold because, well, it&#8217;s an expensive hobby.
