Chicagoist story about a pending lawsuit between a cyclist and a rollerblader and his dog due to a collision on Chicago&#8217;s lakefront path.

The story itself almost belongs in &#8220;The Week In Stupid&#8221;, but the comments to the article are quickly turning into a cry to ban biking on the lakefront path. Interesting if you&#8217;re a Chicago resident, a biker, or both.
