This weekend I had some nice houseguests&#8230;Sara and Scott from St. Louis and from Columbus all came to Chicago for &#8216;s blues party. Also, , , and I had a yard sale with our neighbor Mark. Between selling some videos and bartending at Titus&#8217;s party, I made a couple bucks.

On Sunday afternoon I coached the [Flying Buttresses][1] improv group (I&#8217;ve worked with them before in the past). We played around with establishment and &#8220;games&#8221; of scenes, and then spent an hour working on Harold. As usual, they showered me with appreciation, which sometimes makes me feel uncomfortable (like, who am I, you know?), but as long as they&#8217;re getting something out of my help, that makes me happy. Even when my help means getting up at 10 am on a Sunday after going to bed at 6 am.

Monday night, right before bed, I stepped on a belt which I had tossed on the floor. No problem, except it was my &#8220;hipster&#8221; belt with the giant buckle, and I punctured my left heel with it. So yesterday I went to see my doctor to get a tetanus shot. Fun times.

Tomorrow I am winging off to Raleigh to celebrate Holly&#8217;s birthday on Saturday. And to hopefully wow all those folk with my magical bbq ribs. Good times!
