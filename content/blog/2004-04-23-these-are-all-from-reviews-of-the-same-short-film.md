&#8220;Nice job on the editing as the nine minutes and thirty seconds flew by.&#8221;

&#8220;A fine idea (although we&#8217;ve certainly seen it before) and excellent acting, particularly by Bill and Maggie&#8230;My main complaint is the length. This could be a much tighter five minute short.&#8221;

&#8220;Mediocre acting at times, too long, drags on a bit.&#8221;
