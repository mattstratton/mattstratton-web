Today began the great experiment of biking to work.

I managed to get here just fine&#8230;now, going home will be another story.

It&#8217;s a seven mile ride each way, and took me about 50 minutes door to door. If you want, you can check out my [route][1].

Some things I learned:

  1. When starting at 6:30 AM, being sweaty isn&#8217;t the issue, it&#8217;s being COLD!
  2. By the time you&#8217;ve gone about four miles, you&#8217;re not cold anymore, you&#8217;re sweaty
  3. Tomorrow I will at least bring deodorant, but I think I&#8217;m okay biking in my work clothes
  4. No, I don&#8217;t really smell bad.
  5. My hair looks funny when it gets a little sweaty under a helmet. I need a haircut.
  6. Village Cycle did NOT fix my shifter yesterday, in fact, it&#8217;s worse than it was before. I really miss gear 2:5.
  7. My U-lock is not big enough to fit around my frame, my front tire (detached), and my rear tire. For now, I used the &#8220;accessory cable&#8221; to tie up the front tire and my detached seat, but I need a longer U-lock.
  8. Biking down Wells between the Merchandise Mart and Van Buren is a little scary, but it was actually pretty cool

That&#8217;s about it for today. Totally fun though. I&#8217;m glad I did it, and I&#8217;m looking forward to doing this every day.
