So as of this morning, I feel like I am officially a bike commuter again.

The last time I rode to work was back on June 11, and even then, I only rode TO work (since I got a flat when I got there, and had Carrie pick me up after work). But now, armed with my newly fixed rear tube and tuned brakes, I was a force to be reckoned with.

In fact, this morning at avg speed of 12.29 mph was my fastest ride to work so far. Looking at my [bike journal][1], I can see that I had rides last year that had a faster average speed, however, that was when I had my old bike computer that I think was not as accurate in terms of distance (those rides claim my ride to work was 6.9 miles, but now my bike computer, which is actually precise, says it is 7.12 miles). Although now that I look again, I can see that I have a ride in Sept of last year that was with my new computer, on the same route I took today, with an avg speed of 12.80 mph. Damn. But I still kicked the crap out of my average times for the couple of rides this year :)
