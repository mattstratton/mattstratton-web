Hurrah! New Greg the Bunny on last night!

Warren: &#8220;I leave early on Fridays to go to happy hour&#8230;not because I&#8217;m Jewish and have to go to shul.&#8221;

Tardy: &#8220;I finished my sandwich! Now I&#8217;m a-posed to get pudding!&#8221;

Jimmy: &#8220;We&#8217;re gonna crank it&#8230;while you spank it&#8230;&#8221;

Greg: &#8220;And since I&#8217;m rubbing you with my feet, it&#8217;s good luck too!&#8221;
