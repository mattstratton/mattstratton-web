It&#8217;s should come as no surprise to most of you that I fully embrace OS X. I run it at home and I love it. Of course, I make my living supporting Windows systems, so my work environment is all Windows.

One of my major annoyances is that there are a TON of great utilities and tools that run on OS X that would make my life at work INCREDIBLY easier, however, I cannot use them, since my work environment (my laptop) runs Windows. If I had [Quicksilver][1] at work, there are many, MANY awesome things I could do. But, of course, I cannot. Additionally, having Automator available to me at work would help. 

Yes, there are similar tools &#8211; for example, instead of Quicksilver, I use [Dash Command][2] (don&#8217;t talk to me about [Launchy][3]; I have used it, but Dash has a bit more use for what I do). And instead of Applescript/Automator I can write VB scripts (I know [Powershell][4] is the bomb, but I haven&#8217;t done ANYTHING with it yet).

The worst offender is multi-protocol IM clients. On my Mac I run [Adium][5], which is probably one of the best applications I&#8217;ve ever used. There are three options I&#8217;ve explored on Windows, and none of them hold a candle to Adium. Here are the products I&#8217;ve tried to use on Windows: 

<div style="margin-left:40px;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.ceruleanstudios.com/">Trillian Pro</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.pidgin.im">Pidgin</a>/GAIM
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.meebo.com">Meebo</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

The functionality that I am missing from Adium (that none of these clients can handle) is as follows:

<div style="margin-left:40px;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Displaying only online contacts NO SORTED INTO GROUPS
    </li>
    <li>
      Integration into Address Book (with Adium, it talks to my Address Book and syncs up what is entered as an IM address and then displays that person&#8217;s name in the buddy list instead of me having to manually set an &#8220;alias&#8221;, etc, and it even uses the picture from the Address Book)
    </li>
    <li>
      Actually working with Google Talk (granted, Meebo and Pidgin do this, but Trillian&#8217;s GTalk integration seems to be busted)
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Are there any products I am missing? Meebo is definitely been a good way for me to go, but it requires me to have Firefox open in order to get IM&#8217;s and it needs the [Meebo extension][6] in order for me to get notification of new IM&#8217;s (which is not terrible). My resistance to Meebo is the lack of logging, mostly.
