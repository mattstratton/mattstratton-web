So I discovered I still have some credits on <a href="https://personals.nerve.com" target="_blank">Nerve</a>, so I did a little browsing.

Found one girl on there with a pretty good profile. Her headline was &#8220;So&#8230;that happened&#8221;. So she got instant points there. And she wrote back.

We&#8217;ll see what happens. The point is more that there was a personals ad with a _State and Main_ reference. And it wasn&#8217;t mine.
