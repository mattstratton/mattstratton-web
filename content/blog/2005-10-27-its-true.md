From [Bleed Cubbie Blue][1]:

&#8220;With the White Sox, of course, there&#8217;s a different feeling. They&#8217;re sort of like the friend you had in high school who you liked and got along with, except when he wound up stealing the girl you were interested in, and left you in the dust, and then came back and rubbed your nose in it.&#8221;
