Just talked to Jeff. His new boss is based out of NYC. Apparently, they have like 15 open headcount on that team, although it&#8217;s a slow process to fill them (they can only have 2 req&#8217;s open at a time or some such nonsense).

Anyway, Jeff&#8217;s boss told him that if he &#8220;knew of anyone&#8221;, to pass along the resume. And Jeff asked about locations, and was told &#8220;Chicago, Columbus, or NYC are what we are looking for.&#8221;

So it&#8217;s a start. I&#8217;ll get my resume over tomorrow, and we&#8217;ll see what happens. This would be good for other reasons too; the team is more implementation/project than production (so it&#8217;d be back more like what I was doing as a contractor here), plus, I like the folks on that team. It could get dicey; theoretically, you are supposed to stay in your first position for a year before changing. But let&#8217;s not put the cart before the horse here!

**Edit:** To add to the cart before the horse, it would appear that this team is based out of Brooklyn, and is about a ten minute walk from the area that I really like. Also, Hedda tells me that it is &#8220;really close to Target&#8221;.
