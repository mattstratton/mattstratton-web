I made <a href="https://twitter.com/mattstratton/status/1786645842" target="_blank">a joke earlier this week about creating a &#8220;Good-Looking People&#8221; group in TweetDeck</a>, so that I would have a column that was filled with pretty people avatars. Given that theme of my twittering this week, it seems only natural that my #FollowFriday post would feature folks who have avatars that are easy on the eyes. Of course, that&#8217;s not the ONLY reason to follow them&#8230;

I got the idea for my TweetDeck group after making <a href="https://twitter.com/mattstratton/statuses/1786559033" target="_blank">a comment about how much I liked her avatar</a>. Kelly&#8217;s Twitter pic always makes me chuckle when I see it, and her tweets do that same thing. She shares a lot of great content and really improves the Twitter experience of anyone who follows her.

She&#8217;s also new to the blogosphere, and it&#8217;s fascinating to follow her as she learns to build her <a href="https://curiousillusion.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> and determine how to get it going the way she wants. Engaging and amusing, I can&#8217;t say enough good things about her. She also <a href="/2009/05/11/the-winner/" target="_blank">won the feedback contest</a> here on Good Old Rock, so that means she&#8217;s awesome.

Her tweets focus on personal updates, primarily, but she&#8217;s an active and engaging Twitterer. She&#8217;s building up her following, and I think you should be her next follower. Why? Because I said so, and I have a blog, so why are you questioning me?

I&#8217;m continually amused by her tweets, and she&#8217;s very social and interactive &#8211; which can be a great thing in a person to follow. Also, her hair in her avatar is bright pink which is pretty darn cool.

<a href="https://twitter.com/stackedblog" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5226" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 5px;" title="stackedblog" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/stackedblog.jpg" alt="stackedblog" width="73" height="73" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/stackedblog" target="_blank"><strong>@stackedblog</strong></a> &#8211; It&#8217;s no secret that we&#8217;re a big fan of <a href="https://stackedblog.com" target="_blank">Stacked</a> here at Good Old Rock&#8230;and we love her on Twitter as well. In addition to a fantastic avatar, Christina&#8217;s Stacked feed will keep you up-to-date with everything that is going on with her book blog, plus any fun news and links she discovers that are book or literary related. If you don&#8217;t follow her, I don&#8217;t think we can be friends anymore.
