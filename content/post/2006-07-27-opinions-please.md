So I have a couple photos with some pretty bad shadowing, and was trying to fix them up today. Unfortunately, I decided to do this on my work laptop, which isn&#8217;t necessarily the best tool for this kind of thing. Anyway, I&#8217;m wondering if you all can take a gander and tell me if you think they look okay.

The problem was that the faces under the hats were in deep shadow, and very very dark. I used a [Photojojo trick][3] on them, and I think it worked okay, but I&#8217;m not sure if I was subtle enough.

If you&#8217;re wondering, the same setup was used for both shots (although I obviously didn&#8217;t take the one that I am in) &#8211; as follows:

<table id="Inbox" border="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size:120%;" width="30%">
      <strong>Camera:</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td style="font-size:120%;">
      <strong>Canon PowerShot S2 IS</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size:120%;" width="30%">
      <strong>Exposure:</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td style="font-size:120%;">
      <strong>0.002 sec (1/500)</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size:120%;" width="30%">
      <strong>Aperture:</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td style="font-size:120%;">
      <strong>f/4.5</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size:120%;" width="30%">
      <strong>Focal Length:</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td style="font-size:120%;">
      <strong>6 mm</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Exposure Bias:</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      0/3 EV
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Flash:</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Flash fired, red-eye reduction
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
