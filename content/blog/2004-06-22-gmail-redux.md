I just got a crapload more invite codes in my gmail&#8230;so if you&#8217;re one of the few people who haven&#8217;t gotten a gmail invite in the last week of invite madness, feel free to send me your praise and undying devotion and I&#8217;ll deign to give you one.

Or else you can give me a muffin. Muffins rule.
