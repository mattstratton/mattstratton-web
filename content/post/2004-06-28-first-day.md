So today was my first day at Bank One.

I like it there. The people are pretty darn cool. My friend Jeff (who I used to work with, who works at B1 now) was working from home today, so I didn&#8217;t get to see him.

It looks like I&#8217;m going to have a lot of work to do, which I am pumped up about. I like to be busy. It&#8217;s a good thing too, because just about every website I waste time on is blocked there (I had to check, naturally).

They gave me a pretty cool <a href="http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/11382_na/11382_na.HTML" target="_blank">laptop</a>, although the speaker is making weird noises, so we&#8217;ll have to see if the desktop folks can fix it.

It&#8217;s nice that I&#8217;ll be getting paid every week with this job. Although I&#8217;m a little nervous; I won&#8217;t get my first paycheck until late next week, and I&#8217;m really down to the felt right now, and I think my landlord is getting antsy. Cross your fingers for me!
