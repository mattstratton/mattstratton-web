**My new kitchen. Tracy made the curtains and gave me the table and chairs. Plus a cool new lamp!**

**This is my new office. Well, at least my new desk. Neat!**

**This is the new bar &#8211; so organized! You can see my arm on the left side of the picture wearing my new Kenneth Cole duds.**

**Me standing in the doorway to my new hip closet.**

**My new living room. Lippy matted those pictures for me and put them in nice frames. I can&#8217;t believe that there is an &#8220;Everybody Loves Raymond&#8221; commercial on the TV in the background.**

**More of my new living room. Unfortunately, the cool coffee tables are not in their usual space (you can see them in the far right corner; they belong in between the chairs and the couch). Louis donated the cool jazz guy sculptures. Tracy made the curtains. Spiffy!**

More pictures to come later.
