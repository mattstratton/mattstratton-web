Read this in &#8216;s LJ&#8230;blew my mind.

_Research says that when kids raise their hands in class, it hurts the feelings of the kids who don&#8217;t know the answers, and causes a dirstraction. They are suggesting that students raise their thumbs in a &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; position directly in front of their body. This communicates to the teacher alone, and doesn&#8217;t distract the other students. (Bahahaha &#8212; isn&#8217;t this the most ridiculous thing you&#8217;ve ever heard.)_
