So I was supposed to meet this girl for dinner tonight.

I&#8217;m not sure if it was a &#8220;date&#8221; or not. It had that feel.

She never showed up.

Shows you how reliable people from the Internet are.

It&#8217;s okay though. Now I can go to my friend&#8217;s techno party tonight. I was talking to M earlier tonight&#8230;she said she&#8217;d be my fallback &#8220;date&#8221; to the party if things fell through with dinner.

She&#8217;s supposed to call me in a little while to see if I&#8217;m at dinner or not. Of course, she will discover I was stood up, so now I can go listen to Injection Records drop phat beats, and show up with a hella cute girl to boot. So it&#8217;s not all bad.
