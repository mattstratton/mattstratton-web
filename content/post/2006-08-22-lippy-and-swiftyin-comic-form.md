I was playing around last night with some cool Photoshop tutorials, including one on how to turn a photo into a comic. Since Lippy and Swifty are both huge comic nerds, I figured they were a good subject.

In other news, I rode my bike to work today. I shaved about ten minutes off of my usual time (a combination of smarter shifting and a seat adjustment), although I am a little more sore than usual. It now officially is quicker for me to ride my bike than to take the train. Nifty!
