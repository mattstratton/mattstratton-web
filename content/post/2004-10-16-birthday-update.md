Thanks for the ideas and input for my 30th birthday party.

Unfortunately, I&#8217;m going to have to ignore all of them.

I was informed the other night that I am not allowed to plan my own birthday party. A friend of mine decided to take it upon himself (with the aid of another friend, although he hasn&#8217;t told her this yet) to plan it all.

All that I am allowed to do is give him a guest list and then show up. So it will be a surprise. Neat.

I am actually kind of touched by this. I&#8217;ve always wanted someone to throw a party for me.
