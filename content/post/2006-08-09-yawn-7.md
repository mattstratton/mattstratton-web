I rode my bike into work this morning for the first time in at least four weeks &#8211; actually, it&#8217;s probably been longer than that since I last bike commuted.

It wasn&#8217;t too bad &#8211; I had to bring my laptop with me, so I had a backpack on. This created a lot more sweat than usual, so it was a good thing I brought a change of undershirt. I also braved Wells Street under the L, and managed it just fine (although I did have to get a little aggressive and claim my share of the lane, and I thought a truck was going to run me off of the road). 

Funny thing &#8211; from basically Irving Park Road to the Merchandise Mart, I ended up in a pack of about four or five cyclists. Nobody knew each other, and nobody said anything, but we all ended up riding together &#8211; which helped me, because I could use the others to pace. Averaged about 13 mph the whole way, but it stil took about 40 minutes because of all the stopping.

Today&#8217;s picture is Scout as a puppy from last summer.
