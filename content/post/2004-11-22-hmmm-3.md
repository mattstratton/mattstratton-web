Apparently, since ATA filed for Chapter 11, there&#8217;s been some bidding for their slots at Midway.

One of the possible contenders is JetBlue. They apparently want to start Chicago-to-NYC flights. If that happens, I just might reconsider my aversion to flying out of Midway.

Although my guess is that Southwest will just buy up the slots, and dominate MDW even further.
