Friday night had poker night for Backstreet&#8217;s birthday. Ended up losing my stake ($20) but considering that was all I spent for the night (the game was at my house and everyone else brought beer), $20 for about six hours of entertainment is pretty good!

Saturday I picked up the Jetta. So I finally have a car. No more bus for me! Whoohoo. Of course, it needs a new headlight (which is about $120) so until I get that, no driving at night. But still.

Saturday evening was sushi with Julie, Emil, Sarah, and Chris. Was supposed to do the movie marathon with Backstreet and company for his birthday, but there were communication disconnects. So we went to the Clipper to see the Hoyle Brothers. That was very fun indeed.

Today was brunch at Bongo Room and shopping in Wicker Park. I picked up this Hugo Boss houndstooth jacked (emerald and black) for $20. Came home, talked to Jo on the phone, and am now going to go take a nap.

I think the Jo thing is working out pretty well; we have a tentative date for Friday. Hoorah.
