Just to show that I read my Friends page&#8230;

&#8230;these are the last lines of the last 10 posts on my friends page. (Non-communities, non-this meme and public posts only.)

1. I&#8217;m looking for more.</p> 

2. WTF is it?

3. which with a 7 y/o boy, health insurance is a great thing :)

4. If you aren&#8217;t a big cryer, how do your emotions manifest themselves?

5. OK, so its now January 13th and in many ways I can&#8217;t believe that I am still in Ottawa.

6. well gotta go do some advertising schtuff.

7. So far this week is stellar.

8. I would be temporarily mollified if people in my neighborhood would just park in one spot instead of two or three&#8230;
