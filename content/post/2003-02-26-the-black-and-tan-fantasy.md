_Salute to the Silver Screen_ 
  
March 14th &#8211; 16th, 2003
  
St. Patrick&#8217;s Day weekend &#8211; [Buy Tickets Now!][1]

**Sneak Prevue Night**
  
Friday, March 14th
  
9 PM to 2 AM
  
Studio X &#8211; 3431 W. Diversey
  
We kick off our salute to the silver screen with a night of dancing and music. We’ll get the party started with the prelims for the Black and Tan Jack and Jill dance contest, and your favorite DJ’s will be spinning their best tunes for your Lindy Hopping pleasure.

Tickets will be $10 or $40 for the entire weekend (plus free Dance Bag!), and must be purchased before the event! We cannot sell tickets at the event, so please buy them online!

**$10** or Weekend Pass

**Silver Screen Ball** 
  
Saturday, March 15th (Dress in Black & White encouraged)
  
8 PM to 2 AM
  
Logan Square Auditorium &#8211; 2539 N. Kedzie Blvd

Dance the night away with an evening filled with beautiful people and lots of entertainment – and lots of fun raffle and auction items. Fun, formal, or casual Black and White Attire recommended. Dance to the music of [Lesley Byers and the Jazz Cats][2] . You can dress like your favorite movie star, bust out that tuxedo or cocktail dress from the back of the closet, or just throw on those track pants and a t-shirt, as long as they are black and white!

There will be a silent auction, a dance contest, a dancer auction. All ages welcome, but you must be 21 (and able to prove it) to drink.

**$25 or Weekend Pass**

**Roll Credits Improv Jam**
  
Sunday, March 16th
  
Doors open at 2 PM, competition begins at 3 PM.
  
Beat Kitchen – 2100 W. Belmont
  
This improv competition starts with 20 people and ends with one. The audience is the judge of who stays and who goes, so you&#8217;re not going to want to miss this! Competition open to the first 20 people to sign up, starting at 2 PM. You must sign up in person. If you just want to sit back and relax, you can do that too! This is an amazing time that can&#8217;t be missed!
  
**$10** or Weekend Pass

**Weekend All-Access Pass!**
  
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
  
Be like a star and walk into any Black and Tan event all weekend. The All-Access pass gets you into all three events! Plus, if you order now, you will get a Windyhop Dance Bag free! This pass is the best deal in town, and can&#8217;t be missed!
  
**$40**
