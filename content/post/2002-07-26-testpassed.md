Wow, that was an easy test today in bartending school.

Five drinks in five minutes. Mine were easy, too. I finished in 4:35, and that was with going back and re-making one (the margarita) because I had over-poured.

I had to make&#8230;

1) Margarita, straight up
  
2) Long Beach Lemonade
  
3) Irish Coffee
  
4) Rusty Nail
  
5) Bacardi Cocktail, straight up

I got docked points for slightly over-pouring my Irish Coffee and the Long Beach.

Otherwise, damn easy.
