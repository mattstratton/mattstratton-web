[Fuzzy][1] )one of the actors in my [film][2]) has a [weblog][3] where he&#8217;s been talking about his experiences with DWG. It&#8217;s kind of fun (but strange) to read his take on things (no pun intended).

Strangest for me was reading my email that he posted (with my permission). It looks so much like&#8230;a real email from a director. But then I get to the end, and it is signed &#8220;Matt&#8221;, and I say to myself &#8220;wow, for a while there, I thought that guy knew what he was talking about.&#8221;

Heheh.
