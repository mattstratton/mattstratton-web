CC and I are going to go see [Rock School][1] tomorrow night, but beforehand, she is coming over and I am making her dinner.

I am having a major blank on ideas of something to make. I want something I can do fairly inexpensively, that will be yummy and maybe impressive, and is NOT the wonderful filet recipe that Shana provided me once before (it was good, but I want to try something new).

Ideas? She has no &#8220;food rules&#8221; &#8211; anything goes.
