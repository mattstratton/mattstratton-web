So I just got off the phone with [LustGirl][1]&#8230;we talked for a long time. She seems very nice&#8230;and we&#8217;re going to try to get together next week (since I&#8217;m booked up Tuesday and Wed with the Cubs games, and I&#8217;m going camping this weekend.)

She&#8217;s a 2nd grade teacher in a pretty sketchy area&#8230;sounds intense, but she loves it. I&#8217;m interested to see where this goes.
