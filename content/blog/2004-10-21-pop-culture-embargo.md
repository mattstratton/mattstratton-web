So Marcelo has challenged me to a Contest.

We are going to attempt to go one week (starting tomorrow) without making any pop culture references.

These are the rules:

_Starting tomorrow (so we all can start at the same time) we go for a week without pop culture references in our speech._

_What does this entail?_

_Out &#8211; quoting TV shows, movies, comic book lore, anything mildly geeky, Homestar Runner, All your base, Star Wars Kid &#8211; if it&#8217;s mildly esoteric on the net, it&#8217;s out._

_In &#8211; allusions to respected works of literature and poesy, priceless art, reputed philosophy._

We are still allowed to watch TV, movies, etc. We can &#8220;ingest as much pop culture as we want&#8221;, but not make any references to it.

So if you catch either of us doing so, please report the offender immediately.
