The strange Google searches that bring people to this blog never cease to amuse me. Here&#8217;s a random sampling of some of the more hilarious and obscure search terms that brought in traffic to Good Old Rock in the past 30 days:

**&#8220;I&#8217;m scared of dolphins&#8221;** &#8211; Clearly, this was how Tyra Banks found my blog.

**&#8220;Karolina stefanski&#8221;** &#8211; This one really confused me, because I have no idea who this is. A quick search of my blog pointed out that the list of Â &#8220;20 Things You Don&#8217;t Know About Kissing&#8221; that I [re-posted back in 2003][1] was actually written by her.

**&#8220;How to say happy birthday to my wife&#8221;** &#8211; Pro tip: Open your mouth. Form the words &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221;. Direct them towards your wife. Then thank the powers that be that somehow you, a person who has to use Google to figure this out, managed to find someone to love you.

**&#8220;Boobs get in the way when typing on iPhone&#8221;** &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what is stranger &#8211; that someone has this issue, or that they actually thought Google might provide them with a solution.

What are some of the more amusing search terms that bring people to YOUR blog?
