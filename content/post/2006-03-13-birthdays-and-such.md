This weekend Carrie and I went out to my mom&#8217;s house to have a little combo birthday party action. We surprised my mom by getting a birthday cake from [Weber&#8217;s Bakery][1] (which has the BEST cakes ever &#8211; my grandma always got cakes from there before she moved to Florida). 

The cake was delicious. And we had dinner at Silverado. 

Wow. That was really not that exciting.
