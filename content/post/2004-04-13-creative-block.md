So I&#8217;ve got the DVD authored for **Inventing:Films** (the _Inventing: Music_ and _Inventing: Stephen_ compilation), and it looks cool as hell.

I&#8217;m having a hard time coming up with a case design though.

Any ideas on how I can make this cooler? Anyone graphical want to help me with it?

If anyone helps me with the cover and it&#8217;s super cool, I&#8217;ll give you a free copy of the final DVD :)
