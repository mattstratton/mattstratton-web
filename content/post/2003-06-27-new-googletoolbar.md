Thanks to [Chris Pirillo][1] for pointing out that the [new Google Toolbar][2] is available.

This thing roxxors. Popup blocking. About damn time. Since I can&#8217;t use Safari on my PC, I&#8217;ll have to settle for using the Googlebar.

Which is the coolest thing ever, regardless. They just made it a ton better.
