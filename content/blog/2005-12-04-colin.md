Since Kim keeps uploading new pictures of their baby, I keep having subject matter to practice my photoshop technique on. I kind of like how this one worked out. 

For those of you who care about such things&#8230;here&#8217;s what this image is:

1) Color-corrected (trying out a new workflow for color-correction, which is what started the whole thing)  
2) Juiced up the color balance on the green towel to make it pop  
3) Whitened the whites of the eyes and removed red-eye  
4) Applied Lighting Effects &#8220;flashlight&#8221; style, and then faded it down about 40%  
5) Used simple black layer to create vignette effect  
6) Applied outside framing using several layers and layer styles
