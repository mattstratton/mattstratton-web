<!--StartFragment -->Questions, as asked by :


  
&nbsp;
  
**1. How long have you been dancing, and how often?
  
** I started swing dancing in&#8230;um&#8230;1998 or so. I still go out dancing about once a month, but I don&#8217;t dance much when I go. About every 18 months I get this bug up my ass that I want to get &#8220;good&#8221; at dancing again. This lasts about three weeks, max.

**2. What is your favorite scent?
  
** Vanilla. It&#8217;s soooo sessay.

**3. You have cute, little sunshine cheeks when you smile. Why is that?
  
** I had no idea that I had them. That&#8217;s a nice thing to hear though. I assume I have them because my face is teh pudgy.

**4. What qualities do you look for in a girlfriend?**
  
To be honest, I think I look for a girl that my friends think is hot, and doesn&#8217;t annoy me. Oh. She should also bring the funny. And have really nice legs. And a dog. Preferably a beagle.

**5. Who would play you in a movie of your life?**
  
Jon Favreau, I think. Yeah. That&#8217;d be about right. Although it&#8217;d probably only be him for the &#8220;adult&#8221; Mugsy. Younger Mugsy would be played by&#8230;um&#8230;Frankie Muniz. Yeah.
