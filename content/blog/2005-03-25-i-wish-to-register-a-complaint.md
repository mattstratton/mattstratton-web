And considering that the WGA told me to &#8220;go fuck off&#8221;, I&#8217;m registering it on LJ instead.

**Marcelo:** emmysue just said &#8220;Quick, someone make me a list of ten things I can do to further broaden my perspective. &#8221;
  
**Marcelo:** help me out.
  
**Mugsy:** hm, i already did it for nicole&#8230;
  
**Mugsy:** so the joke&#8217;s kind of been done
  
**Mugsy:** but
  
**Mugsy:** we can do it anyway
  
**Marcelo:** yes but she&#8217;s asked!
  
**Mugsy:** hehe
  
**Marcelo:** I&#8217;ll do the post

\*list is created, 6 of the items come from Mugsy, 4 from Marcelo\*

**Marcelo:** posted.

\*Mugsy looks at yehoodi, notices that Marcelo just posts the list, including a comment insinuating that Mugsy is 300 pounds\*

**Mugsy:** \*ahem\*
  
**Mugsy:** no credit?
  
**Mugsy:** :)
  
**Mugsy:** geez, I help you make the list, and my only shout-out is a BURN?
  
**Marcelo:** heh heh heh.
  
**Marcelo:** hollywood is cruel.
