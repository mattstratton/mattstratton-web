Last night was uneventful. Went home, put my desk together, and then went down to Sarah and Chris&#8217;s apartment. We ordered in some food, watched Buffy and Dinner for Five (more on that later), and then I introduced Sarah to _Red Dwarf_.

I don&#8217;t think she thought it was funny.

Dinner for Five last night was a re-run of a good episode&#8230;Colin Ferrell, Jennifer Garner, Ben Affleck, and Kevin Smith. The most amusing thing to me was how Affleck and Smith never let Ferrell actually say anything. But the banter between Affleck and Smith was fun as always.
