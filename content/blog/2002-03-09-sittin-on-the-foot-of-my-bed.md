You know, for someone who likes to be as busy as I do, I sure do enjoy sitting around and being lazy.

SO MUCH TO DO TODAY. I really should be showering right now. Ben and Dallas will be here in an hour so we can go location scouting. Then I have Clint&#8217;s bachelor party tonight. Tomorrow is workshopping with the GAIA actors, and then we&#8217;re doing a Weakest Link dry-run. Where is the laziness? Show me laziness.

I will point out that this whole &#8220;wireless NIC in the laptop&#8221; thing is pretty sweet. Not as sweet as a ninja, of course, but fairly sweet nonetheless. It&#8217;s pretty cool to be able to lounge in my room and surf at the same time. Of course, that&#8217;s not helping me get enough sleep&#8230;

So I noticed that a couple people I know in &#8220;real life&#8221; are on LJ. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about this. I mean, it&#8217;s actually very interesting to see what goes on in their little pointy heads&#8230;but how comfortable am I with THEM knowing about MY pointy head? I feel like a documentary subject &#8211; documentaries can never be truly &#8220;true&#8221;, because the presence of the camera always affects the subject. Can I be truly open here, knowing that people I will run into at the bar might read this stuff?

(Oh, Carla? SHUT UP! Hehehe.)
