So I just got home from the 7 Sins party.

It was for a friend&#8217;s birthday. A really great time; he had a magician and a burlesque troupe (who were GREAT!)

We also had the SIN TO WIN contest&#8230;different contests for each sin.

I got the phone number of the girl who wone the &#8220;lust&#8221; contest. I&#8217;m not sure what to do about that; at about 2:30 this morning at the bar, when I was leaving she said &#8220;you&#8217;re not leaving, are you?&#8221; and then &#8220;Well, call me sometime, we&#8217;ll hang out!&#8221; and gave me her number. She then kissed me goodbye and said &#8220;you&#8217;re for sure going to call me, right?&#8221;

She was plastered though. I bet if I do call her she&#8217;ll be regretting it.
