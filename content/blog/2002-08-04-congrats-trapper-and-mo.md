Yesterday was &#8216;s wedding.

It was really gorgeous. The ceremony was in a gorgeous chuch. Reception was at Maggianos. Really good food!

Mo looked gorgeous, as usual. And Trapper looked sharp too. I fully agree with Riley &#8211; they&#8217;re the best-looking couple to ever grace this place.

Best wishes kids! Have a great honeymoon and don&#8217;t forget &#8211; I still owe you a broken shower curtain :)
