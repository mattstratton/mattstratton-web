Today&#8217;s been a long day. Carrie and I had breakfast at Cafe Sel Marie in Lincoln Square, and then I spent the rest of the day at Second City, videotaping Cherie&#8217;s grad show (and then taping &#8220;interviews&#8221; with the cast at the bar accross the street).

We&#8217;re dog-sitting for Sammy (Carrie&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s cockapoo) this weekend. He&#8217;s a fun dog, although he&#8217;s REALLY possesive of people, and he gets really jealous if attention is being paid to another dog in his presence.

Carrie&#8217;s out with some of her friends tonight. I spent most of the evening so far laying in bed reading, with two dogs curled up with me. It was pretty awesome.
