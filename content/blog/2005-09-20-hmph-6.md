I still feel like a loser, but I had a nice night of drinking wine and watching TV with and . So that was good.

I am going to the Cubs game in Milwaukee on Thursday with some people from work, and I invited Cocker Spaniel (who has been, lately, sending me a lot of emails telling me how awesome I am).

No call back from Jaymie yet. C&#8217;est la vie. On to the next one, I suppose.
