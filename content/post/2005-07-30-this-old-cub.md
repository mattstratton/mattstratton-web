So I finally got around to watching [_This Old Cub_][1] on WGN just now.

It&#8217;s a funny thing. I don&#8217;t cry much. I have been known to get depressed, and to get sad, but those things don&#8217;t make me cry.

But I had a very hard time getting through this movie without crying. Actually, that&#8217;s not true. I didn&#8217;t get through it without crying. And I don&#8217;t know why.

I think it&#8217;s the nostalgia. I think it&#8217;s thinking about all the history. Seeing the 1969 Cubs fail to win the pennant due to the Miracle Mets. Hearing Santo&#8217;s &#8220;Oh NO!&#8221; when a dropped fly ball cost the Cubs the Wild Card in 1998. Being reminded of 2003. It was tough.

It also made me really kind of think about how I feel about Ron Santo. I get annoyed with him on the radio sometimes &#8211; I listen to Cubs games on WGN to find out what is going on, and occasionally Ron bugs me. But the more I thought about it, and the more I saw of his career and his personality, the more I realized that Santo really personifies what the Cubs are about. He represents what I want out of the Cubs &#8211; I want them to win, I want to believe that they will win, and Ron Santo does those things to. Pat Hughes said that after the game against the Brewers in 98, he saw something he&#8217;d never seen before &#8211; the manager of the team trying to cheer up the broadcaster.

Hey hey, Ronnie. You&#8217;re a strong man, and one day, we&#8217;ll see you in the Hall of Fame. But until then, I&#8217;m happy just seeing Number 10 flying over left field.
