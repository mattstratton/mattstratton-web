I&#8217;ve got some kind of stomach/GI thing going on.

It started this morning &#8211; I just felt awful, but I was supposed to go out to the burbs with Carrie to have pizza with her family. And I would have felt terrible if I blew that off. So I went.

Like I told her&#8230;I probably would have felt just as bad if I stayed home &#8211; it&#8217;s not like it would have been any better.

Now I can&#8217;t sleep &#8211; I can&#8217;t lay down for more than ten minutes at a time without feeling awful. Luckily, I just tested the VPN on my laptop, and it works, so I&#8217;ll be able to work from home tomorrow.

I&#8217;m hoping I feel better. I&#8217;m supposed to go see _The Producers_ with , and then later go hear Lippy spin Xmas tunes at Fizz.
