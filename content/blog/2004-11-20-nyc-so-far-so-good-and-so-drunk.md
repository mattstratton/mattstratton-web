So far, I&#8217;m enjoying myself here in NYC.

Thursday night, went to Frim Fram. I actually danced a couple of times. Although the best dance was a blues dance with .

Friday I worked from &#8216;s house, and had lunch with Amy. Good times. I also set up Amanda&#8217;s new Tivo. She is in love with it, as well she should be.

Last night, met up with a bunch of cats at **Zombie Hut**, a tiki bar in Brooklyn. Had a LOT to drink there, although I managed to stay just mostly nicely buzzed. Even after two frozen Zombies (with a shot of 151 in the straw), a couple of Mai Tai&#8217;s, and some kind of weird shared drink that Ryan and I enjoyed, even though it made us look like two gay boys in a soda shop.

Of course, things progressed from fun to worse after that. Left the tiki joint and went to another bar. Nicole and Ryan proceeded to show off made dancing skills (the bartender was playing some hot jazz tunes) and earned free beers.

Ended the night at a diner with Amanda, Ryan, Jay, and some Westie chick.

Good times, good times. These cats know how to have a good time.
