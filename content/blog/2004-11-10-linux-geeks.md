This is my friend Trapper's rant about Linux geeks. As true today as when it was written

__________
So here is another thing that pisses me off&#8230;why is it that EVERY TIME someone figures out how to run Linux on something, all the Linux F*ckheads have to say how they need to run out and buy one.
  
Linux geek 1: &#8220;I got Linux running on my xbox&#8221;
  
Linux geek 2: &#8220;I hate Microsoft, but I guess I should go buy an xbox now!!!!&#8221;
  
Linux geek 3: &#8220;Can I wack off while I watch you run Linux on your xbox?&#8221;
  
Linux geek 4: &#8220;me too! me too!&#8221;
  
Linux geek 2: &#8220;I only buy American made cars&#8230; but if someone got Linux running on their Honda Civic I would buy one in a second! And then rice it all out like Vin Disel in that one movie with cool cars&#8221;
  
Linux geek 4: &#8220;Me too! me too!&#8221;
