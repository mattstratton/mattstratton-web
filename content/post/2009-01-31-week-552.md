[<img class="alignright" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3460/3242415304_f5fc1e8a3a.jpg" alt="Week 5/52" width="500" height="333" />][1]{.tt-flickr.tt-flickr-Medium} I&#8217;m now 5 weeks into the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mugsy/sets/72157612213865503/" target="_blank">52 Weeks Project</a>. For those of you just joining, this is a project in which I will be taking a different self-portrait of myself every week for a year.

For this week, I decided it was time to venture outside. It&#8217;s actually not that cold today, so I liked the idea of pairing the ski goggles with simply wearing a sweater. Of course, there&#8217;s no need for ski goggles in my flat, Midwestern backyard. But maybe that is part of the fun.

This picture was taken with my Digital Rebel XT, with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007U00X0?ie=UTF8&tag=straigeyefort-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0007U00X0" target="_blank">Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 lens</a>. I processed it using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adobe-65015634-Photoshop-CS4/dp/B001EUBSL0%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dstraigeyefort-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001EUBSL0" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop CS4</a> &#8211; starting with Adobe Camera Raw, I did some basic color-correcting, and then jacked up the saturation in Photoshop (of course, I could have done ALL of it in ACR, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was going to end up doing, hence the opening it in Photoshop). I then popped the white border around the image and saved it as a JPG.

What do you think of this week&#8217;s photo?
