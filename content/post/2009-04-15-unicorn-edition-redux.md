Especially since the tagline of this blog is &#8220;Unicorn Conspiracy Theories&#8221;, it&#8217;s really been far too long since we&#8217;ve featured unicorn-related content.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/huggerindustries/3405290134/" target="_blank"><strong>Freakin&#8217; Magical Unicorn Gum</strong></a> (Flickr)- No explanation for this one, but I&#8217;m not so sure one is required. I do think that &#8220;freakin&#8217; magical&#8221; is redundant when being used to describe anything unicorn-related.

<a href="http://www.unicornmuseum.org/" target="_blank"><strong>The Unicorn Museum</strong></a> &#8211; Described as a &#8220;fully engaging, sensory experience for intellectually undiscerning guests&#8221;, the Unicorn Museum will bolster your belief by proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that unicorns are mentioned nine times in the Bible. Shun the non-believer!

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaCCkfjPm0o" target="_blank"><strong>Charlie the Unicorn Part 3</strong></a> (YouTube)- Speaking of non-believers&#8230;hold onto your kidney, because Charlie is back in Part 3. This one features a rapping shrimp. If there&#8217;s a better use of the Internet, I&#8217;ve not found it yet.

<a href="http://fuckyoupenguin.blogspot.com/2009/03/at-least-i-exist-pretty-boy.html" target="_blank"><strong>F-You Penguin Tells Unicorns To Get Bent</strong></a> &#8211; They might have a point, but I had a really hard time posting a link to such blatant unicorn hate here. But I&#8217;m open minded and I believe in freedom of speech, at least when it comes to unicorns. It&#8217;s okay. The F-You Penguin guys will get theirs when the Magipocolypse comes to thunder down rainbows on their sorry asses.

<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/41/unicorn-chaser.html" target="_blank"><strong>Unicorn Chaser</strong></a> (ThinkGeek) &#8211; Ever see an image or post on the webbertubes that just offends you at a deep and disturbing level? With the Unicorn Chaser shot, you will be able to use Science to clear your brain and your soul&#8230;it&#8217;s just THAT EASY.

Clearly, the unicorns are starting to take over. We already know about some of the <a href="/2009/02/10/unicorns-in-the-real-world/" target="_self">vast Unicorn Conspiracy</a>&#8230;but there&#8217;s got to be more. What say you, Good Old Rockers? What unicorn conspiracies have you uncovered? What will the unicorns take over next?
