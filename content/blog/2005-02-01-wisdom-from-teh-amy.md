My friend Amy gave me this advice yesterday re: women:

_Don&#8217;t listen to her complain about other men. Don&#8217;t be too quick to be a girlfriend. **If a woman is into a guy, she doesn&#8217;t treat him like a girlfriend.** If she starts, don&#8217;t let her. Even if it doesn&#8217;t turn into anything, at least you&#8217;ve saved yourself having to listen to complaining._

This is so very true. I realized how true last night when out with a girly friend. This is a really beautiful and fun girl who I is completely awesome(incidentally, my family ADORES her).

And I am soooo her galpal. I got to hear last night all about this fella that she&#8217;s been on four dates with&#8230;later in the night she kept asking me if it would be inappropriate to call him up (we were not terribly far from his house) and have a late-night popin booty call.

This is not how girls who are into you talk. Fo&#8217; sho&#8217;.

Not saying I&#8217;m chasing, but it&#8217;s a good example, dig?
