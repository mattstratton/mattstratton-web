Just thinking, that when you are organizing an event and choosing the person who will be in charge of composing and creating your communications, maybe the best choice isn&#8217;t the one who is infamous for terrible spelling? Or at least, one might consider proofreading before sending out official emails with the subject <span style="font-size:larger;"><b>Dancers Needed for Live Boradcast on Friday Morning 10/7 fat Ida Noyes Hall!</b></span>&nbsp;

Just sayin&#8217; is all.
