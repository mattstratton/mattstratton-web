Who&#8217;s your best friend? Why?

Last night I was talking to a good friend of mine. And she told me that earlier in the day she had referred to me as her best friend.

It was really touching. I don&#8217;t know why. For some reason, I tend to think of &#8220;best friends&#8221; as something you outgrow in junior high.

It made me really happy that she said that though. She&#8217;s really important to me and I love her a lot. So it made me happy.

Who&#8217;s **your** best friend? Why?
