So, last night, Carrie was sending an email to our videographer. One of the questions was &#8220;how do you want your names listed on the DVD labels?&#8221;

Carrie started typing in &#8220;Carrie and Matt Stratton&#8221;.

&#8220;No, my name should go first, technically,&#8221; I corrected her.

&#8220;But,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you&#8217;re &#8216;Matt Stratton&#8217;. That&#8217;s how your name goes.&#8221;

She then changed it to &#8220;Matt and Carrie Stratton&#8221;.

And the proceeded to flip out, because I think it was the first time she&#8217;d seen &#8220;Carrie Stratton&#8221; in print.

Heh.
