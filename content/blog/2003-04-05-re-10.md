Cable guy is coming in &#8220;35-40 minutes&#8221;.

I&#8217;ll go on the record here and say that by the time this is over today, I won&#8217;t have cable service. AT&T/Comcast is pretty bad in this building about getting things right the first time; when we set up service downstairs, I explained to the person on the phone that WE needed AT&T, but the rest of the building was RCN, and she assured me that was fine.

Of course, the installer comes out, and has no idea what I&#8217;m talking about, and doesn&#8217;t have the right &#8220;service order&#8221; to do that work, so we had to reschedule.

I just get the confirmation call for the service in my new place up here&#8230;the guy on the phone says &#8220;So does your place got the wires?&#8221; And I said &#8220;Well, yes, the unit has cable going to the rooms where the TV&#8217;s are; but the installer will need to change the cabling outside to switch to AT&T from RCN.&#8221;

After several repetions, the dispatcher finally understood what I was talking about, and then proceeded to say &#8220;a technician will be there in 35-40 minutes and he&#8217;ll take a look at it and evaluate.&#8221;

NOTHING TO EVALUATE, MOTHERFUCKER! You guys DID this downstairs about five months ago?

Fuckin&#8217; cable jerkies.
