Dear Lazyweb,

Are there computer speakers you can get that do NOT flake out and get all &#8220;buzzy&#8221; when a cell phone is near them and active? My speakers (which are a one-off brand called &#8220;MasonWare&#8221;) get this fuzzy, buzzy sound whenever my phone is active on the network. Now that I have the BlackBerry, that means that I cannot even have my phone within a foot of my computer, because it&#8217;s constantly talking over the air and making my speakers buzz. I know that it&#8217;s the speakers, because they buzz anytime they are powered on and the phone is near, even if they are not plugged into the computer

Is this something I just have to suck up, or can I get speakers that don&#8217;t have this problem?
