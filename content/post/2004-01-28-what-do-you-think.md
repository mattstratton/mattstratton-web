I&#8217;m thinking of getting these for C\_____ for Valentine&#8217;s Day&#8230;what do you guys think?

Of course, I bet <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://jensantarelli.livejournal.com/"><strong>jensantarelli</strong></a></span> already has a pair. And for that matter, how come ThinkGeek doesn&#8217;t show any &#8220;action shots&#8221; of \*this\* product?
