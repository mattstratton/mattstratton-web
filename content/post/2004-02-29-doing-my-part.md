So all this whining about gay marriage and I decided to do something a little more constructive than fight with rednecks on <a href="http://www.yehoodi.com" target="_blank">swing dancing discussion boards</a>.

I made a $50 donation to <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org" target="_blank">FreedomToMarry.org</a>.

Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
