What a long night. Maybe I&#8217;ll tell ore of the story later, but for now, leave it a this:

1) Played poker at Jeff&#8217;s tonight. Won the tournament and made a $400 profit.

2) After poker went out with Jeff and a couple friends, one of whom is a local promoter of some kind. We barely ever settled on one venue, but I&#8217;ve never been in more VIP sections of hoochie clubs in my life.

3) It&#8217;s 8:30 AM and I just got home. Oh, and I watched _Sin City_ twice last night on bootleg.
