I&#8217;ll post more in depth tomorrow &#8230;

&#8230; but my birthday surprise was to have my entire apartment re-done by my friends. Plus, Brian got me some great new clothes. Then Chris, Lou, Tom, and I went to the spa and did the Jewish Triathalon, and I got a massage.

Met up with people for dinner in Greektown, which was yummy, and then some of us went back to my new cool apartment to hang out, drink beer, and play games.

I&#8217;m completely blown away by what they did. Pictures and details to come.
