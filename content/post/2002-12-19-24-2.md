Sarah got me the box set of the first season of _24_ for Channukah/Christmas/Whatever last night.

So I think I know what I&#8217;ll be doing for the next few days&#8230;

I haven&#8217;t seen the show at all. I&#8217;m looking forward to checking it out. My biggest fear is that I am gonna _love_ it, and then be mad that the current season is in progress.

Oh, and I watched _Live From Baghdad_ on HBO last night. That&#8217;s a helluva flick. I highly recommend checking it out.
