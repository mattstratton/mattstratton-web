Went to see _Be Cool_ tonight with &nbsp;and Tom.

Hilarious movie. I really liked _Get Shorty_, and was not disappointed with this flick. Lots of laughs, and a little bit deeper than its predecessor. The denouement&nbsp; was a bit lacking, but hey, there&#8217;s a LOT for this film to wrap up. Cedric the Entertainer was at his best, especially with his&nbsp;monologue about America&#8217;s appropriation of black culture, which was very<!--StartFragment -->&nbsp;Jules Winnfield-esque in style, if not in content.

Some revisited laughs from _Shorty_, but they don&#8217;t feel stale; they feel like old friends. Well worth a viewing.
