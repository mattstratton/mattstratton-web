So tonight I went out with some friends&#8230;Gaga Girl #2 was supposed to meet us out.

She called me around 9 to find out where we were. I told her and she said she&#8217;d be there in about an hour. I was very excited.

&#8230;until about five minutes later, when she called to tell me that as soon as she got off the phone with me, her crush invited her to a party. She asked me what she should do. I told her to do what she wanted &#8211; so of course she decided to go to the party, thinking she might leave it after an hour and meet up with us. I told her to call me before she left, just to make sure we&#8217;d still be out.

Never heard from her.

\*sigh\*
