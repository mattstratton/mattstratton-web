I just did a listing in my iTunes library or all the stuff I have bought from the iTMS.

I have bought 335 songs. Which works out to be about 20 hours worth of music.

So yeah. I&#8217;m sticking with the players that can play it for now.

Yes, I know, I could do all sorts of things in order to play iTMS stuff on a non-ipod player&#8230;but it all smacks of &#8230; effort.
