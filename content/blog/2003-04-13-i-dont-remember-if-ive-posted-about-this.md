&#8230;apparently whomever had my phone number before me owes a LOT of money around town.

I get collections agencies calling for &#8220;Gwen Holiday&#8221; several times a day. I usually call them back and get the number taken off the list, and that&#8217;s helped.

I&#8217;ve gotten several calls for &#8220;Gwen&#8221; at 5 AM. Not collections, but just people calling for her.

But the best was Thursday. I got three collect calls from **the Cook County JAIL**. Ha!
