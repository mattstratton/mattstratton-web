Carrie and I had a pretty uneventful Valentine&#8217;s Day. Our original plan was to take a cooking class together at the Chopping Block. However, we procrastinated too long, and they were full up.

Our alternate plan was just to cook a nice, romantic dinner together. However, due to the snow and junk, Carrie stayed out in the burbs on Tuesday, which meant that we didn&#8217;t get to go to the Jewel to get the stuff we needed.

So our Valentines Day was spent eating Chinese takeout and watching the finale of Beauty and the Geek. I did surprise her by sending her some flowers at work, and she surprised me by buying me some new computer speakers that don&#8217;t buzz when my BlackBerry is near them. That was awesome.

Oh, and I got her a nice necklace, which I had given to her on Saturday. And we re-scheduled our romantic dinner for this Sunday night instead.
