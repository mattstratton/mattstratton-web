It really annoys me when a Cubs fan catches an opposing team&#8217;s home run, and then, when he goes to throw it back (as it proper), he switches it with another ball, so that he can keep the souvenir.

That&#8217;s just wrong. The point is, throw the ORIGINAL ball back. You shouldn&#8217;t WANT that souvenir. It is a trophy of the OTHER TEAM scoring against the Cubs.
