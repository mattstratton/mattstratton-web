So you remember back in December when I was exchanging emails with that [**really really excited**][1] girl?

So long story short, my friend and I went out tonight with her and her roommate.

First things first &#8211; she&#8217;s really cute. And secondly, in person, she&#8217;s pretty sharp and interesting.

I&#8217;m intrigued to see where this lands. When we left the bar tonight she made some comment about calling tomorrow to go for brunch or something. Yeah. Like any of us are getting up that early. But still. Man.
