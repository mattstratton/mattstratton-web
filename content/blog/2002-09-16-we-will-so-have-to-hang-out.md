I went to an absolutely gorgeous wedding this weekend.

My friend Jason got married&#8230;we&#8217;ve known each other since we were in sixth grade. We&#8217;re also partners in a swing dancing website for Chicago, and I actually introduced him and his wife.

I wasn&#8217;t asked to stand up (which doesn&#8217;t really bother me, especially since it was a very small wedding), but it did make me think about the fact that I&#8217;ve never stood up in a wedding. Never even ushered. And Jay is the last of my &#8220;old-school&#8221; friends to get married. That was weird to think about too.

On the way to the wedding (which was a three and a half hour drive away), the only CD&#8217;s I&#8217;d brought to listen to were Johnny Cash and Tom Waits. Not exactly wedding music, let me tell you. But the long drive, listened to these two songwriters, provided me with a lot of time for introspection.

For example &#8211; the song &#8220;Better Off Without a Wife&#8221; &#8211; it makes a lot of sense to me. I can really see where the narrator is coming from. And it&#8217;s okay.

Plus, I also decided that my new favorite Johnny Cash song is &#8220;One Piece at a Time&#8221;. It&#8217;s really funny.
