This morning at 4 AM, we were awoken by a loud BANG, and the power went out. I called ComEd to report it, and was told that &#8220;as soon as a crew was on site&#8221;, I could call in and get information from the automated assistant. So I set the alarm on my phone, and went back to sleep.

At 6:30 this morning, when we got up, the power was still off. I called ComEd and the automated system said &#8220;we have no information on a power outage at that location&#8221;. So I sat on hold for 30 minutes until finally someone answered, and then put me back on hold for about five more minutes while she &#8220;checked into it&#8221;.

Her answer?

&#8220;I called the Chicago office, and they said they have to replace a transformer that burned out overnight. They are getting one on location, but do not have an ETA as to when service will be restored. It will probably be out for the rest of the morning and maybe the afternoon.&#8221;

This sucks. My poor dog is home with no AC and no fans. Poor puppy. Luckily Carrie will be home after noon, so if the electric is still not working, I guess she can drive him around in the car to cool him off.
