Does anyone have any idea how to properly create a boot disk (DOS) with the driver for the Netelligent 10/100TX PCI Embedded UTP Controller? This is a Compaq Deskpro 6300MMX. According to Compaq&#8217;s site, that embedded controller uses the e100b.dos driver. That doesn&#8217;t work. Under Win2K, it uses a NetFlex3 driver&#8230;but when I try to use netflx3.dos it does load either.

Anyone? Anyone?
