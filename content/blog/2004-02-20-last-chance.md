Don&#8217;t forget&#8230;I still have a few advance copies of _[Dancing With Gaia][1]_ available, but I need you to [order][2] by 1 PM Central today so I can ship &#8217;em to you!

I first posted about this [here][3], but if you&#8217;re new to my friends list, here&#8217;s some more info:

I am one half of [Gravy Train Films][4]. Our mission statement used to be &#8220;to make the best no-budget, experimental films that Chicago has ever seen, and simulataneously spend all of Matt&#8217;s money, and a bunch of Dallas&#8217;s,&#8221; but has since changed to &#8220;doing the right things all of the times.&#8221;

Our first movie was a swing dancing mockumentary entitled [_Dancing With Gaia_][1] which was shot in the spring of 2002. We&#8217;ve also done some short films which have been [moderately well-received][5].

You can read more in the [posts about my movies][6]. Feel free to ask more questions and I&#8217;ll answer them
