I&#8217;m ready to quit my job. But nothing new seems available on the horizon in my industry. I don&#8217;t know what to do here. I don&#8217;t want to quit without having a job to go to &#8211; that&#8217;s just dumb.

But maybe I should quit and just get some other local crap job at Kinkos or something to pay my bills for a while until something better comes along. I&#8217;d rather work at Kinkos than spend an hour each way on the bus heading out to Glenview for a job I hate that doesn&#8217;t pay well anyway.

Ideas?
