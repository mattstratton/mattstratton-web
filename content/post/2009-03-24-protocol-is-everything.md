[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4986" style="margin: 4px;" title="kate-breakdancing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/kate-breakdancing-300x200.jpg" alt="kate-breakdancing" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/kate-breakdancing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/03/kate-breakdancing-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][1]So we&#8217;re starting over from square one with our latest baby-making attempt. Last Friday, Carrie had some tests and discovered that the current medication (known in these circles as a &#8220;protocol&#8221;) was not having the desired effect &#8211; so this month&#8217;s IVF has been cancelled.

We had hoped to &#8220;get started&#8221; in the next week or so, but due to this setback, we&#8217;re pushed back a month. At least the doctor agreed that she doesn&#8217;t need to do a cycle with birth control (which is nice since we don&#8217;t have to wait as long, plus, those meds were messing with Carrie&#8217;s sleep), so hopefully the new &#8220;protocol&#8221; will have a better effect. This means that we don&#8217;t go &#8220;into the lab&#8221;, so to speak, for at least another month. So there will be no new Carriematt baby born in 2009 &#8211; our kiddo will come in 2010.

Wow, that&#8217;s weird to say. Hard to imagine that someone will be born in the year 2010. It&#8217;s so very Arthur C. Clarke.

For the record, this picture has nothing to do with IVF or infertility. It&#8217;s just a funny picture I took of our niece Kate last night. She&#8217;s doing a somersault, but I think it totally looks like she is breakdancing.

This whole infertility thing is getting quite frustrating. And not the least of the frustration comes from the fact that I cannot think of something better than &#8220;infertility&#8221; when I blog about it. I need new words so that my writing is more interesting. I also need something more interesting to discuss on this topic &#8211; it seems like it is a lot of &#8220;Well, _that_ didn&#8217;t work, so we&#8217;re trying this now&#8221;. Again, and again.

It&#8217;s no lie to say that this is harder on my wife than it is on me. I don&#8217;t think that is because I am a futuristic cyborg sent from the year 2243 to protect the future by becoming a master of SharePoint. Nor do I take the easy way out by saying &#8220;Hey, you know how women are&#8221;&#8230;because I am not an idiot. I think for me it&#8217;s easier to just take a &#8220;long view&#8221;. Or at least it has been. I have to admit that it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to counsel patience to my wife, but that&#8217;s my job. But if this goes on much longer, my &#8220;big picture&#8221; lens is going to get a lot cloudier.
