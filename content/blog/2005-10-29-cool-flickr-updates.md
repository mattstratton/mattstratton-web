As most of you know, I am in love with [flickr][1] and want to have sex with it.

Well, they finally did the one thing that I thought they needed the most &#8211; you can now order prints directly from flickr (I actually used to use a greasemonkey script that tied into Shutterfly for this, but I like the way they have it set up better). You now also have the ability to order CD/DVD backups of all your pictures, which I really needed as well.

Here&#8217;s the scoop:

### 26th October, 2005

New stuff! After many, many requests for the feature, you can now order prints of your photos. There are two parts to this: 1) [Set up your account for printing][2], and 2) Share your photos for printing with [this preference][3] (the default is &#8216;only you&#8217; can print them). The catch? In this first release, printing on Flickr is only available to members in the U.S. &#8211; don&#8217;t worry, this won&#8217;t be the case for eternity. (Read the FlickrBlog post for more info.)

Once you&#8217;ve turned everything on, you&#8217;ll be able to see an &#8220;Order Prints&#8221; button on a photo you can print, as well as a brand new menu on your set pages, called &#8220;Make stuff&#8221;. You can add a whole set to your shopping cart at once if you like.

The other cool stuff? We want to give you as many ways as we can to [do more stuff with your photos][4], so we&#8217;ve partnered with some other businesses to offer you more than we could possibly do on our own.

**Enjoy!**
