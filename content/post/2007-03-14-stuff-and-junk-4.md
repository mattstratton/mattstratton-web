This picture is from last spring, but I just came across it in my Flickr favorites, and since the weather is getting nice, I liked it.

I am getting bored with working at home, and it&#8217;s only Wednesday.

Just sent the address list and final wording to our [invitation lady][1]. Yet another complicated thing to figure out &#8211; how to address the envelopes. This actually turned into a bit of a debate with Kim on Saturday night &#8211; mostly because she has to make everything complicated by being a doctor. Darn her!

And&#8230;speaking of, I just noticed an error in the spreadsheet I sent with the addresses. And the error was with Kim. Darn her again! :)
