Some random questions and thoughts of the day, inspired by various conversations.

Firstly, if a someone referred to their girlfriend/wife as &#8220;high maintenance&#8221;, what would that mean to you? I will tell you my answer after I see yours.

Also, what would you think of me if I told you there was a girl that I thought was really smart and funny, and pretty cute, but she just didn&#8217;t have big enough breasts for me, so I couldn&#8217;t see dating her?
