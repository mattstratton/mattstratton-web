So I&#8217;ve realized&#8230;.

I just can&#8217;t be attracted to a woman who doesn&#8217;t dress well.

Call me shallow. But there&#8217;s a girl who is pretty into me, and I&#8217;m not so much into her (for various reasons), but one of them is just&#8230;she doesn&#8217;t dress well.

Not that she&#8217;s a slob. But she can&#8217;t put an outfit together. I showed a picture of her, and she said something like &#8220;ye gods, that is a horrible outfit&#8221;. And it made me realize&#8230;I have seen this girl when she thinks she&#8217;s all spiffed up&#8230;and it&#8217;s just terrible.

Lots of skants, for one thing. Ick.

Call me shallow. I&#8217;m coming to terms with it.
