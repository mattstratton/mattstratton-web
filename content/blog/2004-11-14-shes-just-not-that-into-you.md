About a year or so ago (maybe longer, now that I think about it), I came to a realization about one of the [Gaga Girls][1].

I just wasn&#8217;t her type. And I never would be. And it had nothing to do with personality &#8211; I just wasn&#8217;t good-looking enough for what she liked.

It wasn&#8217;t easy, but I did it.

It doesn&#8217;t make it any easier when I come to that conclusion these days either. I guess the only thing that makes it somewhat easier is to realize that perhaps I do that to some girls and I don&#8217;t even know about it. Maybe I don&#8217;t, but I like to think that I do &#8211; it makes it not quite as painful when it happens to me.
