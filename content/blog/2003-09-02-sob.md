Well, I was supposed to go to Las Vegas this weekend for a friend&#8217;s bachelor party.

But some extra costs of moving, plus a mysterious charge on my debit card (I am currently on hold with the company who charged me), have knocked my bank account down to nothing.

I think I can&#8217;t go on the trip now. Which sucks, because a) Vegas kicks ass, and b) I will end up paying $313 for airfare and hotel that I won&#8217;t use.

Grrr. More to come as updates roll in.
