No particular theme this week &#8211; more of a random trip through posts and stories I read this week that I thought were share-worthy.

<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/15/awesome-kid-gets-detentio_n_462837.html" target="_blank">Awesome Kid Gets Detention For Being Hilarious</a> &#8211; You might be sick of &#8220;that&#8217;s what she said&#8221; jokes (although if you are, you sure aren&#8217;t my friend Jenn), but even if you are, you gotta love this. Why do you have to love it? Because if you don&#8217;t, the terrorists win.

<a href="https://funkatron.com/site/comments/were-the-stupid-ones-facebook-google-and-our-failure-as-developers/" target="_blank">Weâ€™re the Stupid Ones: Facebook, Google, and Our Failure as Developers</a> &#8211; Out of all the follow-ups to the whole &#8220;a bunch of Facebook users got confused and thought a tech blog was Facebook&#8221; brouhaha, this is my favorite. And not because they linked to me and sent over 700 visitors my way. Well, not TOTALLY, at least.

<a href="https://www.lifewithoutpants.com/words-of-wisdom/big-world/" target="_blank">The World Is a Lot Bigger Than You Think </a>&#8211; Our pal Matt Chevy almost always has great content, but this post really hit home to me. If you don&#8217;t see success as a zero-sum game, you&#8217;ll likely dig what he&#8217;s laying down here.

<a href="https://gizmodo.com/5470334/giz-explains-why-iso-is-the-new-megapixel?skyline=true&s=i" target="_blank">Why ISO Is the New Megapixel</a> &#8211; To some of us, this is just common sense. But if you&#8217;ve been buying into the megapixel myth (here&#8217;s a test to see if you have &#8211; do you know how many megapixels your camera has, but not it&#8217;s max usable ISO? If so, then bam! You are mythbusted&#8230;or something), you really need to read this to understand what the TRUE measure of quality and usability of a consumer digital camera should be.
