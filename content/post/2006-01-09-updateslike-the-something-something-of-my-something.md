I&#8217;ve been getting complaints that I&#8217;m not updating this blog in an interesting fashion. This update will be similarly un-interesting. But here&#8217;s what&#8217;s been going on over the past few days:

On Friday, I worked out of Carrie&#8217;s house and did laundry &#8211; I talked to my boss, who told me that we&#8217;ll be hearing about bonuses &#8220;soon&#8221;, and that he knew they had been cut back, but the bonuses for our team that they submitted were between 10K and 50K. So I expect to get a Starbucks card and a ham. Later, Carrie and I welcomed Zoe to Chicago with some frozen pizza. Then we sallied-forth to [Improv Olympic][1] to see Baby Wants Candy (my favorite team at IO) with Tracy, Brian, and their friend Mark. The show was somewhat disappointing &#8211; I mean, it was good, but it was certainly not on par with the usual BWC stuff I&#8217;m used to. Most of my favorite cast is gone &#8211; except the one guy I love, who reminds me of [Adam Ferrara][2] &#8211; he was great as usual (and had a brilliant connection line to close the show).

After the show, Carrie went home, but the rest of us hit a couple bars for some cocktails. We ended up at Tracy and Brian&#8217;s house, where we played poker until 3:30 AM. Mark ended up winning, although it got down to heads up between the two of us, and I made some stupid bets, ending up losing on Big Slick. Oh well. These things happen.

On Saturday, Zoe and I met her sister and Carrie at Orange for brunch. A delightful meal of frooshi (&#8220;fruit sushi) and other brunchy things. Later on, I finally got to visit the Lincoln Park location of Hemas Kitchen, which was just as good as the tiny and crowded version further north.

I bid adieu to Zoe, and met up with Carrie, Heather, and Chris at Merle&#8217;s up in E-town for some BBQ. The evening ended with a raucous game of &#8220;Taboo&#8221; and many beers at Heather&#8217;s house.

Sunday morning I walked [Scout][3]. I spent most of Sunday reading _[Total Money Makeover][4]_ by [Dave Ramsey][5], and listening to his [podcast][6]. Oh, and I watched the new _Family Guy_.

The end.
