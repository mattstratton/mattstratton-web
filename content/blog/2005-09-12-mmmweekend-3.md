Good weekend.

My pal Kim was in town for a baby shower, and then she came by for hot backyard bbq action. It was just like old times; all the usual suspects were there. Most awesome. Plus, Mo and Trapper brought their adorable daughter. I was bad and had a couple cigarettes, but overall, good time.

Still coughing a lot. Going to try to get to the doctor today, or more likely, tomorrow.

Going camping next weekend. Fun.
