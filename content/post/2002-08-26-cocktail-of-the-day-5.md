Even though it&#8217;s the summer, I am posting up a wonderful coffee drink. I really like this one, and you can have it any time of year (rules about what to drink when have pretty much flown out the window in today&#8217;s society).

**Nutty Irishman**

1/2 oz. Frangelico
  
1/2 oz. Bailey&#8217;s Irish Cream

Pour into footed coffee mug. Fill with coffee. Top with whipped cream.
