It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve done a post like this, but considering that yesterday I got a <a href="/real-world/unicorns-in-the-real-world" target="_blank">flaming blog comment</a> from an 11 year old Canadian who found my blog by Googling &#8220;are there real unicorns on earth?&#8221;, it seemed only right and proper to resurrect the concept.

Now, for your reading enjoyment, some of the Google queries that got people to my blog in the past thirty days:

**Erika Buchholz** &#8211; this is actually a friend of mine, and the hits are because of the <a href="/life-in-general/erika-buchholz-opera-singer" target="_self">super fun interview</a> I did with her a while back. I&#8217;ve also learned from Google that there is an &#8220;Erika Buchholz&#8221; who is a real estate agent. That&#8217;s not my friend &#8211; mine&#8217;s the soprano.

**ferret girl** &#8211; As I commented on <a href="http://youllgrowtoloveme.com/2009/12/14/i-had-pet-ferrets-dont-judge-me/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>, a former possible romantic candidate was code-named &#8220;Ferret Girl&#8221; by me. Not because she looked like a ferret, but because she HAD ferrets.

**hottest picture ever** &#8211; I&#8217;ve gotten several hits from this. They all end up at <a href="/life-in-general/this-is-the-hottest-picture-ever" target="_blank">this post</a>. Unfortunately, whatever picture it was that I thought was so hot&#8230;it didn&#8217;t make it over when I migrated from LiveJournal. Sorry to disappoint you, hot-picture-seekers&#8230;

**jenna fischer divorce** &#8211; Another case of disappointed Googlers&#8230;this ends up taking them to a <a href="/life-in-general/on-the-topic-of-jenna-fischers-impending-divorce" target="_blank">post which mostly just makes fun of Arcecat</a>.

**jobs are for losers** &#8211; I get hits from this query on a weekly basis. It&#8217;s sad reflection on the work ethic of the Internet community.

**unicorn gravy** &#8211; There&#8217;s quite a few unicorn-related searches that lead to my blog, but this is my favorite one. I wonder if it&#8217;s good on mashed potatoes?

**Scout the Sheltie** &#8211; I find it kind of awesome that someone would look for this specifically &#8211; but wouldn&#8217;t already know my website. That&#8217;s an interesting Venn diagram to draw.

**marrying yourself in colorado** &#8211; When you couple this with the searches I get for &#8220;shana&#8217;s breasts&#8221;, a frightening (but not surprising) picture begins to emerge. And if you&#8217;re not a Yehoodite of a certain era, you won&#8217;t understand why.

**Swifty wins** &#8211; Yes. Yes he does. But did you have to search Google to find that out?
