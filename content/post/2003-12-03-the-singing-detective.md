<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314676/" target="_blank"><strong>The Singing Detective</strong></a>
  
Directed by Keith Gordon
  
Written by Dennis Potter
  
Starring Robert Downey Jr, Robin Wright Penn, and Mel Gibson

This movie was a lot darker than the trailer led me to believe. _The Singing Detective_ takes us inside the mind of Dan Dark, a detective novelist who blurs the lines between reality and fantasy while hospitalized for a skin disorder.

Robert Downey Jr gives a great performance as always, although there is much more depth to his characterization when in &#8220;reality&#8221;. The film leaves a lot of questions unanswered, and we all know that I am a fan of ambiguity in films, so that was a major plus. The trailer led me to expect a madcap romp, and while _The Singing Detective_ doesn&#8217;t skimp on the laughs, the film makes you think. A lot. I&#8217;m going to need some more time to digest it. It wasn&#8217;t the best film I&#8217;ve seen this week so far, but I would still give it three stars. If stars count for anything.
