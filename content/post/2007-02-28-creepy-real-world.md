**Trapper:** bring a drink!  
**Matt:**you got it, Toyota  
**Trapper:** ?  
**Trapper:** is this some interweb joke I am not in the loop on?  
**Matt:** there was a toyota commercial from the early 80s*, I think, where they would say &#8220;you got it, Toyota&#8221;  
**Matt:** and my mom says it all the time, and sadly, I apparently am turning into my mom  
**Trapper:** i thought we are suppose to marry people like our mothers&#8230; not become them  
**Trapper:** is carrie like your mom?  
**Matt:** no, I don&#8217;t think they are similar. my mom has smaller hooters  
**Matt:** (okay, that was just creepy)  
**Trapper:** lol  
**Trapper:** now the question is&#8230; are you going to RealWorld that.   
**Trapper:** or should I?
