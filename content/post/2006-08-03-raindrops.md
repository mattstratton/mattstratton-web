At least the heat&#8217;s finally broken. Funny thing &#8211; last night Cherie was over working on her Second City video, and when she left for the L, it was pouring rain. So I offered her the use of my umbrella, saying she could just bring it back on Sunday when she comes over to finish up.

Of course, I get up this morning and it&#8217;s raining. But not that bad. It was just kind of amusing to me. 

No big plans for tonight &#8211; I was going to go out with Jeff and some other folks, but I just don&#8217;t feel like it. I think I&#8217;ll stay home and do some more editing. And count down the days until next Wednesday, when Backstreet and I will be seeing Mr. Tom Waits, live and in concert.

Oh, and Samuel L. Jackson called me last night from &#8216;s phone, to encourage me to go and see _Snakes on a Plane_. He did not need to do so &#8211; we are already planning to take the afternoon off of work for a field trip to view the film.

Today&#8217;s photo was taken in the spring of 1993, my senior year in high school. In case you cannot tell, I am the one on the left.
