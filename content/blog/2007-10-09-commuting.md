So I recently (as in last week) got a GPS for my bicycle &#8211; a [Garmin Edge 205][1]. The desire was for a device that would make it easier for me to track my rides, and also to improve accuracy.

I [took it for a spin yesterday][2], and really liked how it worked. However, my average speed was lower than I was used to seeing with my Cateye, so I started to wonder how accurate the Cateye was.

This morning, when I [rode into work][3], I used both the Garmin and the Cateye, to see what the discrepancies were. Here were the results.

Garmin  
Distance: 7.05 miles

Cateye  
Distance: 7.17 miles

This, of course, results in the Cateye thinking I am going faster than I am. That was kind of a bummer to discover &#8211; that my average speed has been about 1 mph slower than I thought.

Oh well. If you want to see my rides, check them out below (I have f-locked this entry since you can obviously figure out where I live and work from this).
