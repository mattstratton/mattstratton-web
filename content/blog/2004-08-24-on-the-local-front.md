There&#8217;s this chick I met last week at the Fizzle&#8230;she&#8217;s old school (back in the Liquid days) who for some reason has started coming out again.

She was out again last night, and ended up going out with me and some other friends after Fizz. One of said friends observed to me that he thinks she is into me &#8211; she offered to give me a ride home (even though I live about three blocks from where we were) and I got a nice little kiss goodnight. I got her number and email as well (ostensibly so i could invite her to Partytom&#8217;s birthday thing, but I found it interesting that I asked for her email, and she wrote down her number as well).

I read too much into things. But hell, at least she&#8217;s local.
