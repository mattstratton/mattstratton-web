I&#8217;ll be celebrating my birthday on Saturday, Dec 10. If you want to join me, here&#8217;s the details:

Since it&#8217;s the holiday season, I thought to start the festivities off with the **500 Clown Christmas Carol**. The show is only $15 and will be awesome. Afterwards, we will retire to **Suite Lounge** for libations, frolicking, and general merriment.

Tickets for the show can be purchased **online** or at the theater. It&#8217;s &#8220;general admission&#8221;, so we can all sit together, or whatnot.

If you cannot make the show, but want to meet up later, we will be meeting at **Suite Lounge** at 1446 N. Wells at 10 PM. We have a private booth/table thing reserved, so just look for either myself or Chris. Hope to see you there! Any questions, call me on my cell @ 773-220-5940.

More info about 500 Clown can be found on their **[website][1]**.

More info about Suite can be found at **this story** on Metromix.

If you are thinking of coming, please email me at **[matt [dot] stratton [at] gmail [dot] com][2]** and I&#8217;ll add you to the Evite so I can have an idea of how many people to expect.
