Thoughts on the _Buffy_ finale, &#8220;Chosen&#8221;:

I think that there were some really funny moments in the finale, and I really enjoyed it. Especially the Trogdor bit. And Anya had some great throwaway lines (&#8220;Let&#8217;s go summon the cannon fodder&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;re not calling them that, honey&#8221; &#8220;Well, not to their _faces_, what, am I insensitive?&#8221;).

But jebus, marry, and josef, Joss&#8230;what a bunch of self-indulgent cinematic masturbation! Every single scene had another camera &#8220;trick&#8221; that was rarely motivated by dramatic necessity. By themselves, each bit was fine&#8230;but the visual style of the entire episode was so disjointed and incongruous it was almost laughable upon secong viewing.

Fight scenes were fun. Although one of the Potentials had some HORRIBLE wire work on a flying kick right after the SIT&#8217;s all get &#8220;activated&#8221;&#8230;that was a shame.
