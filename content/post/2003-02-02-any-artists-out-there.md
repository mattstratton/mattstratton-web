So I came up with an idea for another tattoo tonight&#8230;I&#8217;d like to take this picture and make it a tattoo&#8230;but a little more stylized. It&#8217;s not because I want this girl tattooed on me, but rather this representation (the angel with the beer and cigarette).

Any of my lovely friends talented enough at sketching to put this together? I&#8217;ll be your best friend&#8230;
