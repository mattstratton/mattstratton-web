This completely reminded me of old IM&#8217;s between [Trapper][1] and and myself:

Geek #1: Let&#8217;s just eat at Applebee&#8217;s.  
Geek #2: Dude, that&#8217;s like the most expensive Applebee&#8217;s in the universe.  
Geek #1: Not &#8220;like&#8221;. Literally, it is the most expensive Applebee&#8217;s in the universe.  
Geek #2: Ah, not so. In a constantly expanding universe, the probability approaches 100% that somethere out there exists a more expensive Applebee&#8217;s.  
Geek #1: &#8230;Let&#8217;s just eat at KFC.
