**Christina:** they just fixed Hubble which they say should let us see back 13 billion years (approx)
  
**Christina:** with speed of light and all that jazz &#8211; if there was life on another planet in another galaxy &#8211; wouldn&#8217;t we find out about them after it was too late
  
**Christina:** Like they could build a teleporting ship to come kill us, and we wouldn&#8217;t know because we&#8217;d be dead cause we didnt&#8217;t see it coming?
  
**Matt:** they probably already did
  
**Matt:** and we just didn&#8217;t notice yet
  
**Christina:** because it just hasn&#8217;t happened in linear time yet?
  
**Matt:** or because we are paying too much attention to Grey&#8217;s Anatomy

&#8212;

**Christina:** stupid humans
  
**Christina:** &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you scientists see the aliens coming?&#8221;
  
**Christina:** &#8220;Well, we noticed bacterial life on another planet, but that was 12 billion years ago based on speed of light&#8230;and we were too busy reading _Twilight_ to bond with our tween daughters to give it more thought&#8221;
