You know how they say that men marry their mothers?

I was noticing today how Gaga Girl #1 looks like a younger, hotter version of my mom.

I mean, they don&#8217;t really look anything alike. Somewhat simliar hair and skin color. But some of the personality is the same.

I was hoping that this realization would creep me out and get me over her. But it didn&#8217;t.

Is that sick?
