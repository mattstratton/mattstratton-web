Wow, we had a great time today. A bunch of cool friends came over for cookout and beers. Ryan brought his birthday pinata (which, apparently, was left-over from March), and we all regressed to childhood and gave it a whack.

Evin and Noah&#8217;s daughter Kesiah got to meet our niece Katelyn, which was fun. And we got to welcome to her new home town in style.
