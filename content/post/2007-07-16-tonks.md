Carrie and I went with Jessica last night to see _Harry Potter and The Magicallly Annoying Tourists Who Walk Really F&#8217;ing Slowly_ at Navy Pier.

I liked it. Except for the Navy Pier part. The 3D was annoying. The movie was fun, but unremarkable.

However, I have to say that Tonks looked a lot like my friend Jolene. Which is a compliment to Jo, since Tonks was effin&#8217; hot.

(That&#8217;s the chick who played Tonks, not Jolene, since, to my knowledge, there are no pictures of Jo anywhere on the intertubes).
