Tomorrow is my first test in bartending school.

Apparently it will be to mix five drinks in five minutes&#8230;they can be any five drinks pulled from the classifications I have learned: two-liquor, sours, wine cocktails, and hot drinks.

We were doing a speed drill today, and had to do ten in ten minutes&#8230;I did fifteen :)
