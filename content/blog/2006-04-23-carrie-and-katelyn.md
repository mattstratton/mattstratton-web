Yesterday was a busy day! Scout and Carrie and I went to the dog beach, where he ran like a crazy person into the water, and quickly got himself covered with wet sand all over his fur. Which resulted in a doggy bath. I have to say, Scout is quite a tolerant dog for such things.

After that, Carrie and I went out to the suburbs to meet her sister&#8217;s new baby, [Katelyn][1]. And then it was back to my folks&#8217; house for some cookout dinner action.

Good times.
