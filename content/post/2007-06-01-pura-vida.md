More later, but in case you were wondering, Costa Rica is awesome. When we return I have about 3 GB (no exaggeration) of photos to go through. I think we might overload Flickr.

Today we saw some monkeys. And some sloths. And a lot of iguanas. I also swam in the Pacific Ocean and it kicked my ass.

Tomorrow we are going to be zooming through the treetops on zip lines. We&#8217;ve already gone canyoning (rappelling down waterfalls) and flew in a very tiny airplane.
