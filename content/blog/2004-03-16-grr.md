So as you may recall, Carrie dropped my Powerbook a while ago.

Well, I&#8217;ve been getting a LOT of crashes since then. Today it&#8217;s been blowing up constantly. I thought it might have something to do with the 10.3.3 update I installed, so I decided it was time to blow everything away and start over.

Hmph. During my clean install of Panther, it kept crashing. Until I took the battery off. Now it&#8217;s fine. So the gist is, my Powerbook is no longer &#8220;portable&#8221;.

Dammit.

And now I have to reinstall all my applications. What a pain. But at least my system will be squeaky clean.
