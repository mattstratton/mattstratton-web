Just for kicks, I submitted a picture of myself for my [IMDb page][1], but they rejected it.

Here was the the picture:

[<img src="https://static.flickr.com/28/43563418_cbaec80f32_m.jpg" alt="Proposed IMDB picture" height="240" width="179" />][2]

The reason for rejection:

_We&#8217;re sorry, but this image failed
  
to meet our quality standards and
  
has been rejected for one or more
  
of the following reason(s):</p> 

* Too Blurred or jagged
   
* Too Grainy/Pixelated
   
* Too Dark
   
* Too Many Artifacts (compression
  
level too high)</i>

Any suggestions for another photo to submit? Since I already paid for it, I need to put something up there.
