They make the best chili in the cafeteria here at work&#8230;it&#8217;s almost sweet tasting. I love it.

Trick is&#8230;I&#8217;m eating too much. I get the chili \*with\* my sandwich. Which makes my lunch more expensive, plus it will make me get fat. But since I&#8217;ve not really been smoking anymore, I&#8217;m going to get fat anyway.

So either I&#8217;m gonna have a heart attack from being fat, or lung cancer.
