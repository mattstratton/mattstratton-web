I read [Bruce Schneier][1]&#8216;s blog pretty regularly (he&#8217;s a security technologist and I like to keep up to date on what he has to say about technology). This was from his  [entry today][2]:

<span style="font-style:italic;">I am reminded of a dead drop technique used by, I think, the 9/11 terrorists. They used Hotmail (or some other anonymous e-mail service) accounts, but instead of e-mailing messages to each other, one would save a message as &#8220;draft&#8221; and the recipient would retrieve it from the same account later. I thought that was pretty clever, actually.</span>

I guess it just goes to show that no matter what safeguards you try to put in place, they&#8217;re always going to be behind what clever people can come up with.

Schneier&#8217;s stuff is generally pretty good. His [evaluation][3] of the whole FISA thing was very illuminating.

Plus, sometimes he blogs about [squid][4].
