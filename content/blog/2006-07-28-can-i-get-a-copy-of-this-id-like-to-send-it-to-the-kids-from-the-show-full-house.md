Incidentally, this picture was from our camping trip a while ago. I like it.

I&#8217;m so very tired today. For some reason, I really had a hard time falling asleep last night, so I was up until 2 AM watching _[The Aristocrats][1]_ &#8211; which I really enjoyed. I think my favorite rendition was by Wendy Liebman (hers was the reversal where the routine is very hoity-toity, and then the name is quite vulgar). Carlin was fascinating as always, and who can&#8217;t get enough of Bob Saget telling a story that involves fecal matter as &#8220;spin art&#8221;?

I&#8217;m rarely a fan of Mario Cantone, but his rendition of the joke as told by Liza Minelli made me laugh and laugh.

Sarah Silverman stole the entire show, however.
