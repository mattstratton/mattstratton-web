Thanks to my friend Doug, I discovered that Netflix now has a neat thing&#8230;if you go to your Friends page, it gives you a little quiz about them:

Oh, also&#8230;those of you on my Netflix Friends List&#8230;you should put stuff in under &#8220;My Two Cents&#8221; when you rate a movie&#8230;it&#8217;s a lot more helpful than just a star rating, to know what you thought of it. The end.
