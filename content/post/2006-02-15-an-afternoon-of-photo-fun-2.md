I came home from work a little early today, and took some pictures around my neighborhood. I actually found a bunch of neat things to photograph in my backyard. This picture is of a &#8220;No Smoking&#8221; sign in the stairwell behind my apartment.

Fun stuff indeed. You can see the rest of today&#8217;s pictures [here][1].
