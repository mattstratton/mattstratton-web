I&#8217;m going to prove that. Instead of coming up with some new, awesome content this morning, we&#8217;ll take a walk down memory lane and look back to some old-school blog posts of mine &#8211; one from each November going back as far as my blog goes. Enjoy the trip, and keep your hands and feet inside the web browser at all times. _(Oh, and don&#8217;t forget to <a href="http://www.sam-e.com/job/profile/195" target="_blank">vote for Doniree</a>! Vote every day until Nov 6, 2009!)_

2008 &#8211; [**I expected this to happen, just not so quickly**][2]: Shortly after moving the suburbs, I went through a point when I felt completely disconnected from my friends. The good news is, looking back a year later, I can see I was totally over-reacting. My relationships with my city pals are just as good as they were before we moved &#8211; they&#8217;re different, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but they&#8217;re still strong. Lesson to be learned? Don&#8217;t be such a whiner.

2007 &#8211; [**eBay Annoyances**][3]: Actually, there were a bunch of blog posts in Nov 2007 about my new job, but I think that the eBay post is more interesting. Basically, I was going back and forth with an eBay seller who didn&#8217;t ship me some books&#8230;and decided to &#8220;out&#8221; them in my blog. This didn&#8217;t actually accomplish anything.

2006 &#8211; [**Gilmore Girls = downgrade**][4]: If I recall correctly, this was the beginning of the last season of _Gilmore Girls_&#8230;and clearly, I didn&#8217;t think it got off to a good start. And looking back three years later&#8230;I still agree. The last season of _Gilmore Girls_ was full of fail.

2005 &#8211; [**I like taking pictures of things**][5]: This is not really an in-depth blog post (it&#8217;s mostly just a link to a Flickr set) but it&#8217;s an important one. It represents a trip that Carrie and I took together which ended up being the final catalyst for the two of us getting back together&#8230;which turned into getting married&#8230;and now we&#8217;re having twins.

2004 &#8211; [**Fine. Run away**][6]: Posted right after the 2004 Presidential election, it&#8217;s my response for everyone who was claiming they were going to move to Canada since George W. Bush had been re-elected President. Looking back, my predictions that everyone world-wide was going to be impacted when GWB started WWIII were a tad bit over-dramatic, but my core comment (which was &#8220;Don&#8217;t be such a cowardly wimp&#8221;), still stands.

2003 &#8211; [**Girly update**][7]: Carrie and I met in October of 2003. This post, from early November, is an &#8220;update&#8221; on how things were going. My favorite part is the last line: &#8220;I feel good about this, I think.&#8221;

2002 &#8211; [**Quickies**][8]: Some random update postings. I had just moved in with Sarah and Chris, and was out of work (but doing some side consulting). Also, there were a bunch of random girls I was involved with, but nothing really good. Nov 2002 was a pretty cruddy month for me.

And that&#8217;s as far back as my blog goes. Seven years worth of Novembers&#8230;and I have to say, things are sure looking up!
