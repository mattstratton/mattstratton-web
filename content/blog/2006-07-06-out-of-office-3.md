First of all, my new thing is to post a picture in each LJ post. Even if that picture has nothing to do with what I&#8217;m posting about. But it should make for more visually interesting posts from me. 

You&#8217;re welcome.

Anyway, tomorrow around noon Carrie and I will be heading up to Michigan to spend the week at her parents&#8217; lake house. We&#8217;ll be back on the 14th, just in time to welcome Heather, , and into town for the Mets/Cubs series at Wrigley. 

Nothing much more to report. Took Scout to the groomer today. At least his doggie dreadlocks are gone now. For the rest of the night I&#8217;ll be cleaning, packing, and doing last-minute errands before traveling.

I&#8217;ll probably check my email a few times while we&#8217;re gone, but I&#8217;ll be away from LJ and all the other stuff otherwise, so if it&#8217;s important, call me &#8211; otherwise I&#8217;ll catch up with all of you when I get back!
