  Cinco de mayo, blowout, denial<br /> It wasn&#8217;t fun this time, letting you go<br /> What if I never, a bullet forever,<br /> Held out my hand to you?<br /> We wouldn&#8217;t have known beautiful flow
</p>

<p>
  Absolute measure, I ain&#8217;t no pleasure hound<br /> Bus out of control, ploughing the road<br /> Out on a bender<br /> Just Alice falling down a deepening hole
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;d never been to Rome until you smiled<br /> You&#8217;re about as old and piled
</p>

<p>
  Used to pray for snow<br /> Now I just wonder<br /> What spell I was under<br /> Thinking you thought of me as something to hold
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;d never been to Rome until you smiled<br /> You&#8217;re about as old and piled
</p>

<p>
  Cinco de mayo, burn-out Ohio<br /> It wasn&#8217;t me this time letting you go </span>
