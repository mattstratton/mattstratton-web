No caption contest this week. Just a quick list of some of the more hilarious terms people type into Google that result in them visiting Good Old Rock:

  * wallowing in my own crapulence
  * download charlie the unicorn 3: charlies soulmate
  * opposite of sausage fest
  * stupid electricity photos

Clearly I dominate the &#8220;crapulence&#8221; keyword. Bow before my &#8220;opposite of sausage fest&#8221; pagerank!
