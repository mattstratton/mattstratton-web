So I went to see _Team America: World Police_ tonight with Partytom and Kim.

It was pretty much exactly what I&#8217;d expected. I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to say it&#8217;s the funniest movie ever&#8230;or even the funniest movie of the year. But as a send-up of action movies, it was great. And they nailed the _Thunderbirds_ marionettes perfectly.

I could have done without some of the scatological humor, but I expected that going into a Parker/Stone flick. And the movie was surprisingly homophobic &#8211; well, maybe not for a Parker/Stone project. But the Cartman-esque Kim Jong Il was damn funny. And I loved all the songs. Especially the one about _Pearl Harbor_.

It&#8217;s good for a laugh &#8211; I&#8217;d recommend checking it out, but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend going out of your way to see it.
