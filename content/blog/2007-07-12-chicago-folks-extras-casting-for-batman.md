Just read this on [Yelp Talk][1]&#8230;

> This Saturday July 14 from 10:00 a.m.-3:30 p.m. There is a casting call for Extra&#8217;s for a movie being filmed throughout Chicago until October&#8230;sounds like some sort of urban thriller maybe set sometime in the near future. 
> 
> They are holding the call at Chicago Academy for the Arts- 1010 W. Chicago Ave, (Chicago & Halsted) 60622 
> 
> They ask that you bring a recent color photograph and a pen. You will fill out a registration card. The casting is being done through Joan Philo casting &#8211; [www.joanphilocasting.com][2]. 
> 
> Also, this is a paying gig!

Might be kind of cool to check out. Although our Saturday is pretty full&#8230;
