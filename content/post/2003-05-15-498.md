Just got home from _Reloaded_.

First of all&#8230;there is no colon in the title. In both the opening titles and the end credits it was _The Matrix Reloaded_.

I&#8217;ll post more about my thoughts tomorrow (behind a lj-cut tag, never fear). But I will say that I recommend it. But you really should have seen the first one.

And if you can, watch the two parts of &#8220;The Second Renaissance&#8221; at [www.theanimatrix.com][1] before seeing _Reloaded_.
