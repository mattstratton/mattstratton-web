What do these things have in common?

Well this Friday night at the Jefferson Tap the Tom Beeyachski Band will be playing to benefit [Miss Kittyâ€™s entry in the Avon Breast Cancer Walk][1]. Profits from the gig will be donated to help this very worthy cause, because we hate it when bad things happen to good breasts.

Here are the details:
  
Friday Night Jan 23rd, 10:00 PM &#8211; 2AM
  
@ The Jefferson Tap
  
325 N. Jefferson St. (West Loop &#8211; Near Jefferson and Fulton)
  
Link to info about the Bar &#8211; <a href="https://www.jeffersontap.com" target="_new">https://www.jeffersontap.com</a>

The bar has free parking in a lot two blocks south!

Tons of great entertainment for only $5 bucks!!!
