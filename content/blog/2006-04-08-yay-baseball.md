So my boss called me this afternoon and offered me a ticket to go with him to see the Cards/Cubs game tomorrow night. He even arranged for someone else to cover for me for my &#8220;on call&#8221; for tomorrow night.

Awesome.

And I&#8217;m taking Thursday off of work to go to the game with Carrie.

I heart baseball.

And I heart Matt Murton. He&#8217;s my favorite Cub of 2006.
