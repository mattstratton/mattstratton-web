Man, she&#8217;s getting a lot of work all of a sudden, isn&#8217;t she?

I saw _Lost in Translation_ last night. I really really liked it. And then today I saw the trailer for _Girl with the Pearl Earring_ in front of _New Suit_ (FYI, don&#8217;t bother with that one&#8230;I liked it better the first time I saw it when it was called _The Big Picture_. Or maybe it was _Swimming With Sharks_. Or that movie about the PA who steals the dailies from the big blockbuster movie.)

Anyway, I&#8217;m happy that she&#8217;s doing a lot. I really thought she was excellent in _Ghost World_. The &#8220;new&#8221; look for her reminds me a lot of my sister Debbie. Maybe it&#8217;s the pensive thing; in both LIT and GWTPE, she seems to do a lot of looking at things. Like my sister does.
