So while I&#8217;m sitting here, bored, waiting for this Win2k install to finish for the new [Windyhop][1] server, I decided to take you all on a virtual tour of my apartment!

This is the coolest room in the house; our &#8220;front&#8221; living room. Faces the street. My roommate has cool
  
furniture in here, and she hung those curtains all by herself. We&#8217;ve never taken down those white
  
Christmas lights, because, well, they work well for parties. No, we&#8217;re _not_ in college.

This is the view of our fireplace, which kinda works. Although my roommate has been known to smoke
  
out the entire building by freaking out and pouring water on a perfectly safe fire in it&#8230;above the mantle
  
you can see her autographed picture of Cindy Lauper that she got at Tower Records this past Thursday.
  
She lied to her boss and said the cable guy was coming so she could go&#8230;

Another angle on the front room. I kinda dig those columns that Susanna has put there. Notice all the
  
plants? I was in charge of watering them when she was in Europe. And none of them died!

That is the best chair in the entire world. Behind it you can see the messy office area; it really needs
  
to get organized. My fish tank is in the background.

A close-up on the office area. Yes, there are _four_ computers at that desk. But I only use two of them.
  
And one is the new WH server, so it&#8217;s going to be leaving soon anyway.

Here&#8217;s our hallway. Whoops, I just noticed I need to change a couple of light
  
bulbs&#8230;

Long shot of the hallway. My roommate&#8217;s bike is in the foreground. I keep
  
walking into that damn thing in the dark.

My messy room. I haven&#8217;t cleaned it since coming back from NYC, and now there&#8217;s a bunch of stuff from
  
the living room in there until painting is done.

Our &#8220;TV&#8221; living room. Still being painted, so it&#8217;s pretty empty. Nice windows though, eh?

Another angle on the TV room. FYI, we&#8217;re going to paint the trim white instead of green; you can get
  
a real feel for how that will look in this picture.

Our kitchen is also filled with living room stuff. The door leads out into the sun room.

This is a cactus that Susanna put outside. She kept forgetting to water the plant that used to be out
  
here. Pretty bloom, eh?

One of the views from our roof deck. I think this is to the southeast.

The view from the roof facing west down Wellington. St. Alphonsus church is
  
down in the distance. It&#8217;s famous for something, but probably not the
  
fact that I used to take improv classes next door to it.
