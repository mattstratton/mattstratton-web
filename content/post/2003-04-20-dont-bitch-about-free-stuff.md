\*sigh\*

As some of you know, I run the [website][1] for swing dancing in Chicago.

The site is completely free. We have a [fundraiser][2] every year, but long story short, if you are a band, venue, or instructor affiliated with swing in Chicago, we provide some damn good free advertising for your shit.

So I get this email today from a promoter in the scene who pisses me off in general. First of all, I have never seen this fuck at a Black and Tan. We promote the SHIT out of his events, and he has never so much as said &#8220;thank you&#8221;, much less helped support the site (every other major promoter in the city has been most appreciative and supportive). Additionally, on the website for his last big event, he had a page that listed the people/groups that &#8220;helped keep swing going&#8221;&#8230;and Windyhop was not listed.

So anyway, I get an email from this jackass this morning complaining about how his upcoming event was listed in our weekly mailing. Basically, he didn&#8217;t think we put enough about it in the weekly mailing we send (which is a &#8220;bullet point&#8221; style email&#8230;a &#8220;just the facts, ma&#8217;am&#8221; type thing). Never mind the fact that in the calendar there are extensive details about this event&#8230;and a huge fucking NEWS STORY on the front page of the site?

People like that can go piss up a tree, sideways.

(I realize that it may be very clear who I am talking about to some of you, and I will trust your discretion. I also must remind you that the views in this LJ entry are my own, and do not reflect those of Windyhop as an organization.)
