I just looked in our online company phone book. Previously my title was &#8220;Open Systems Engineer II&#8221;, with no &#8220;Officer&#8221; title.

Well, here&#8217;s how it reads today:

**Matt Stratton**
  
Officer Title Vice President
  
Job Title Dist Computing Engineer Sr I

Of course, no change in salary :)

I should point out that the &#8220;Vice President&#8221; title doesn&#8217;t really mean much. I&#8217;m not quite sure why we have them, except to look good on your business card when you&#8217;re trying to pick up chicks.
