I guess I should probably update LJ-land on some things that have been going on in my life. I haven&#8217;t posted about these things, and this way you can all be brought up to speed.

In late November/early December, [Carrie][1] and I started &#8220;dating&#8221; again. While I was off on my two-week &#8220;sabbatical&#8221; to Burbank/Denver/Minneapolis, I had a lot of time to ponder things. One of the things that I realized was that I really belonged with Carrie, and that she was a pretty wonderful person (her love of _Full House_ notwithstanding). When I got back, Carrie and I started having some pretty in-depth discussions on the subject. Just in time for my birthday, she was my girlfriend again.

Things are going really great. We&#8217;re getting along awesomely, and I feel super good about the whole thing. In fact, we&#8217;re going to get an apartment together in May (her lease is up March 31, and mine is April 30, but she&#8217;s going to see if her landlord will extend her an extra month).

This is a good thing.

(There was a reason I was posting this, but I forget what it is now)

**By the way &#8211; Carrie reads my journal, so please keep in mind that she&#8217;ll see any comments you make, okay?**
