It&#8217;s a slow afternoon here at work, so prepare yourself for some random word spewage.

Firstly &#8211; this weekend, Carrie, Scout, and I are heading Up North to spend the holiday frolicking at my in-laws&#8217; lake house. We are quite excited. Especially since tomorrow night we&#8217;ll be breaking up the drive by spending the night with [Angie][1], [Brian][2], and their adorable new puppy, [Maggie][3]. I hope Scout is nice to Maggie &#8211; he&#8217;s been pretty intolerant lately of dogs who want to wrestle with him, as puppies are wont to do.

We were supposed to have our new furniture delivered tomorrow, but turns out they can&#8217;t come until &#8220;between 2 and 6&#8221;, and since I have to pick Carrie up from work at 4:30, that won&#8217;t work. So it has been rescheduled for Tuesday. 

I actually think I had some other stuff to talk about, but I don&#8217;t remember what it was (got distracted by some work stuff). Carrie and I are settling into being an &#8220;old married couple&#8221;. I think we&#8217;re both kind of bored &#8211; after the wedding, we don&#8217;t have a big project anymore, and it&#8217;s going to be a while before the projects of &#8220;house&#8221; and &#8220;kids&#8221; start up. So we&#8217;re in a bit of a limbo state.

I am trying not to get my hopes up TOO high for the Cubs &#8211; there&#8217;s still quite a few games to go, but it&#8217;s nice to have it be almost September, and actually caring about the games. 

September is shaping up to be a bit of a busy month; we&#8217;re taking Carrie&#8217;s mom to Ravinia for a folk music thing one weekend, and then there&#8217;s the &#8220;group&#8221; campout at the end of the month (if I get around to booking the site, and if Lippy gets around to telling me if he and Julia are going to join us). October is also filling up &#8211; one weekend is the &#8220;guy campout&#8221; with my friends Jason, Dan, Dan, and Clint &#8211; it&#8217;s a tradition going back to 1993, and I&#8217;ve only missed it about three times (actually, I think I only missed ONE of the campouts, but there were two years, I think, that it didn&#8217;t happen at all). And then we&#8217;re going to NYC to see
