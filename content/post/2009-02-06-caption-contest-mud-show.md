It&#8217;s Friday, and at Good Old Rock that means a post that is just for fun. Got that? ENJOY THIS POST, DAMMIT.

Rules are rules, people.

This week, I&#8217;ll totally be stealing an idea from my friend over at <a href="https://gorillasushi.com" target="_blank">Gorilla Sushi</a> and doing a caption contest. This is the Internet &#8211; nobody&#8217;s expected to be 100% original.

**Post your captions for this picture in the comments below**. Happy Friday!
