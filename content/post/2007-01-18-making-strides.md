First of all, this picture doesn&#8217;t really have a whole lot to do with my post, other than the fact that I think it&#8217;s a decent picture of me.

Anyway, for those of you keeping track at home, I have lost **19 pounds** since starting my biking/diet/workout last May. Granted, there have been some yo-yo&#8217;s during that time, and I still have quite a ways to go (I&#8217;m about halfway to my goal for the wedding), I think that I&#8217;m making some nice progress. 

My new gym regimen is definitely paying off &#8211; I lost two pounds in the last two weeks, and I am also starting to feel the beginnings of some core muscles underneath my flab of a belly (which is shrinking ever-so-slightly) and my chest and arms are already showing more size and definition. Which I think is nice, but someone else thinks is nicer.
