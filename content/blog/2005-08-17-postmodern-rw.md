<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Emmysue4you:</strong></span> and then when Rocky Roccoco showed up at your clarinet recital &#8211; it changed your life. And I don&#8217;t mean for the better.
  
<span style="color: red;"><strong>Mugsy:</strong></span> clearly not
  
<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Emmysue4you:</strong></span> True, nobody could expect you to anticipate the incident involving the insulation and the collard greens &#8211; and Mr. Roccoco&#8217;s consequent lawsuit &#8211;
  
<span style="color: red;"><strong>Mugsy:</strong></span> not even nostradomus
  
<span style="color: red;"><strong>Mugsy:</strong></span> &#8230;or lindyphil
  
<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Emmysue4you:</strong></span> but people do expect that you take advantage of every helicopter ride offered to you, in order to overcome this thing. Do you understand what I&#8217;m telling you?
  
<span style="color: red;"><strong>Mugsy:</strong></span> frighteningly enough, I do
  
<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Emmysue4you:</strong></span> Well, I&#8217;m relieved. And so is the parakeet.
  
<span style="color: red;"><strong>Mugsy:</strong></span> good. I worry about that bird.
  
<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Emmysue4you:</strong></span> You need not. What you need to worry about is the roadside rest stop. You know the one. And don&#8217;t pretend that you do not.
  
<span style="color: red;"><strong>Mugsy:</strong></span> seriously, I wish you&#8217;d let that go already. I told you &#8211; just because I bought a Twix bar from a vending machine doesn&#8217;t mean that I want to become a professional guitar player.
  
<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Emmysue4you:</strong></span> Don&#8217;t hide behind false pretenses. The filing cabinet does not beget the hot springs. You know the score.
  
<span style="color: red;"><strong>Mugsy:</strong></span> whatever. I&#8217;m so sick of you putting on the blue backpack and turning into Ms. &#8220;I Know The Words To The Song&#8221;.
  
<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Emmysue4you:</strong></span> Whatever, Mr. &#8220;I ignore the fantasy when the insurance policy startles the shoe horn.&#8221;
  
<span style="color: red;"><strong>Mugsy:</strong></span> see, now you&#8217;re just not making sense. I have NEVER acted like that. It&#8217;s a complete fabrication of the mellodorf.
  
<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Emmysue4you:</strong></span> Of course I don&#8217;t make sense to you! You never learned to bantificate. And that will be a constant potato upon your aquarium.
  
<span style="color: red;"><strong>Mugsy:</strong></span> Purple gloved moofbap der fleoodrip ut mooring.
  
<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Emmysue4you:</strong></span> You take that back. I am farpilsting!!!
  
<span style="color: red;"><strong>Mugsy:</strong></span> You lie. I know you. You&#8217;ve never farpilsted in your life. You don&#8217;t have a big enough zoornop.
  
<span style="color: blue;"><strong>Emmysue4you:</strong></span> Actually, I do. The plaibrogamast told me so.
