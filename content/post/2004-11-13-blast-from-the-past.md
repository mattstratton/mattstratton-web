So this is random.

I got an email a few days ago from this girl, Janelle, that I dated back in&#8230;1998 or so.

This was the girl with the crazy militia-joining, conspiracy-theory-having, pistol-packing father. I haven&#8217;t talked to her since we broke up, so this was really out of the blue.

Anyway, we caught up on IM &#8211; she&#8217;s married, has a kid, and lives in the burbs now. She seems to have gotten her life pretty put together (when we went out she was a MESS).

She wants to get together and hang out sometime &#8211; apparently her husband doesn&#8217;t like going into the city, or some such stuff. I&#8217;m not quite sure how I feel about this.
