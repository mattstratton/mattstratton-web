OK, so this is something that annoys the crap out of me with Trillian.

I can&#8217;t over-ride other people&#8217;s buddy icons. I set a cool icon for someone, and then five minutes later, the stupid AIM advertisement icon is back (or the goofy pink flower, or whatever).

Anyone know how to fix this? Is GAIM better for this kind of thing?
