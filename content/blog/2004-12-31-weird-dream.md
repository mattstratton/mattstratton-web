I am jotting this down before I forget&#8230;I wish I could remember all the details.

I was at some kind of dance event &#8211; it felt like it was in NYC, and that it was also a loungy event. There was a small dance floor, with a &#8220;bar&#8221; kind of thing all around (imagine a small roller rink kind of feel). At one point, Amy W gestured for me to dance with her, but by the time I got up and headed her way, she was asking someone else to dance. Then Amanda asked me to dance, which we did (poorly, and I&#8217;m sorry to say that you were wearing flip flops, Amanda&#8230;weird). After the dance, Amanda complained of being hot, and took off her sweater (it was on over a dress &#8211; this was not a Topless Amandapance dream). Somehow a bunch of us ended up sitting on some stairs, drinking our cocktails. I didn&#8217;t recognize any of the other people we were with, but one had the name Epanema (Amanda said, as we approached the stairs &#8220;Poor Epanema&#8221;). Amanda knocked over her drink, the glass broke, and that was the last we saw of Amanda. Suddenly I was in a car driving along with this Epanema girl (who was kind of pudgy and unattractive) &#8211; I was sitting shotgun, she was in the middle, and some guy who I never quite recognized (although I&#8217;m 99% sure it was Monsignore) was driving. He was very drunk. Then, for a split second, the car was a convertible, and sitting next to me on the other side was a fat, nasty guy (imagine Curtis Armstrong mixed with Ron Jeremy) who was also really flatulent.

The car kept driving, and then we drove into a park. Someone was worried about the cops, and we saw a few firemen running accross the grass with axes. We got out of the car and started walking down the hill &#8211; suddenly a ferret came bolting accross, and bit me on the leg. Then I woke up.

Interestingly enough, this dream occured during a catnap that was no longer than 15 minutes. Crazy stuff.
