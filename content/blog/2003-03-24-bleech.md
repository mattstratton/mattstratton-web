So I&#8217;m sick.

I thought it was just a cold I caught last weekend, and then I thought it was &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; of my lungs clearing themselves out from not smoking for the last few days.

But today my whole body hurts, I&#8217;m coughing a ton, and it&#8217;s tough to breathe.

Stupidfey germs. I have so much work to do today but I can&#8217;t. Stupidfey company for not giving contractors remote access.
