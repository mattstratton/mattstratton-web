I am both really excited and really dreading this weekend.

Here is what I am excited about:

  * Awesome blossom friends coming into town, including and [Amanda][1] and [Kathy][2].
  * Fun poker/party on Friday night
  * Getting to show off the new Windyhop software
  * Finally being &#8220;done&#8221; with Windyhop

Here is what I am dreading:

  * Having to get up ass-crack early on Saturday morning to do some Bank work and also to start the data migration for Windyhop
  * Fear that the cold weather and/or snow will hurt our numbers
  * Having to spend the major part of Saturday getting ready for the event and running around like a madman

So as you can see, there are many more exciteds than dreads. Saturday is just going to be a pain, but hopefully it will all be worth it!
