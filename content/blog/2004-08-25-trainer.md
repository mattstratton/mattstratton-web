So apparently knows my trainer. Well, she knows him in that he was the guy who did her assessment when she started at the gym. I didn&#8217;t realize he was as young as he is. But he seems a pretty good guy, although somewhat chatty. (I&#8217;ll be in the middle of really working hard, and he&#8217;ll say &#8220;so what did you do this weekend?&#8221; Weird.)

Today was rough. I can&#8217;t believe I got through what we did, but I accomplished it. If I keep this up, the fatass you know as Mugsy will be long gone. I really wish I had a camera to take progress pictures with, although I still look fat to myself. Even though I know I am toning up and look better than I did two weeks ago, it&#8217;s still a long road.

But I shall prevail!
