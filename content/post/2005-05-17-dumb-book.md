I read Dan Brown&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic;">Digital Fortress</span> on the plane on the way home yesterday.

Wow. What a pile of crap. I really don&#8217;t like him. In both this book and <span style="font-style:italic;">The DaVinci Code</span> he just sort of hits this thing at the end when he goes &#8220;oh, crap, the book&#8217;s almost over&#8230;um, well, then an elf came in and suddenly all was revealed.&#8221;

Also, if these characters are supposedly so smart, why can&#8217;t they figure out these super basic puzzles that we all &#8220;get&#8221; by page 12?
