&#8230;but this is ridiculous.

[**Group blasts PETA &#8216;Holocaust&#8217; project**][1]
  
_(CNN) &#8212; The Anti-Defamation League has denounced a campaign by an animal rights group that compares slaughtering animals to the murder of 6 million Jews in World War II._

The graphic campaign and exhibit &#8220;Holocaust on Your Plate,&#8221; devised by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, juxtaposes 60-square-foot panels displaying gruesome scenes from Nazi death camps side by side with disturbing photographs from factory farms and slaughterhouses. One shows a starving man in a concentration camp next to a starving cow.

The exhibit opens Friday in San Diego, California, and went up Thursday at the University of California at Los Angeles. It also is posted on a PETA Web site, [www.masskilling.com][2], which calls for support for the campaign from the Jewish community.

The comparisons prompted an angry statement from Abraham Foxman, Anti-Defamation League national director and a Holocaust survivor.

&#8220;The effort by PETA to compare the deliberate, systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;PETA&#8217;s effort to seek approval for their &#8216;Holocaust on Your Plate&#8217; campaign is outrageous, offensive and takes chutzpah to new heights.&#8221;

Lisa Lange, PETA&#8217;s vice president of communications, told CNN&#8217;s &#8220;American Morning With Paula Zahn&#8221; on Friday that the idea for the public relations effort came from the late Nobel Prize-winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer, who, she said, wrote: &#8220;In relation to them [animals], all people are Nazis; for them it is an eternal Treblinka.&#8221;

Lange said the campaign is appropriate because &#8220;Nazi concentration camps were modeled after slaughterhouses.&#8221;

The quote, which the group draws upon in its literature as well, comes from a Singer short story, &#8220;The Letter Writer,&#8221; in which the main character Herman Gombiner is musing on the plight of animals. Treblinka was a Nazi death camp in Poland. Singer was a vegetarian who believed strongly in animal rights.

&#8220;It&#8217;s shocking, it&#8217;s startling, it&#8217;s very hard to look at,&#8221; Lange said of the exhibit. &#8220;We&#8217;re attacking the mind-set&#8221; that condones the slaughter of animals.

&#8220;The very same mind-set that made the Holocaust possible &#8212; that we can do anything we want to those we decide are &#8216;different or inferior&#8217; &#8212; is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day,&#8221; PETA representative Mark Prescott wrote in a statement, which added that members of Prescott&#8217;s family were murdered by Nazis.

The Anti-Defamation League statement, however, counters that &#8220;abusive treatment of animals should be opposed, but cannot and must not be compared to the Holocaust.&#8221;

This disgusts me beyond belief. Has anyone seen what [Moby][3] has to say on this topic?
