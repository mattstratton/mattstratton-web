We got our first wedding present in the mail today (as I am told that shower gifts are different somehow. I don&#8217;t get it). It was pretty exciting. I like getting mail.

We&#8217;re also freaking out a little bit, since the deadline for our RSVP&#8217;s is on Tuesday, and there are still 28 invitations outstanding (which is more than 1/3 of them). I&#8217;m sure it will all work out, since most of the &#8220;outstanding&#8221; ones we have a pretty good idea of if they are coming or not. But it&#8217;ll be nice once we know for sure.

Also just finished up the list for the DJ of &#8220;play/don&#8217;t play&#8221; songs. Although I still have to find a song for Carrie to dance with her dad to. He wants something &#8220;instrumental&#8221;, and probably slower jazz. We&#8217;ll be digging through iTunes later tonight, I&#8217;m sure.

Our programs are pretty much done. We have to finalize a few things, but I think we&#8217;ve got them under control. Which is good, because we&#8217;re having our final meeting with the priest on Tuesday, and he&#8217;s gonna need to know all this stuff.
