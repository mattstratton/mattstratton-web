So I finally got my webbernet back up, after spending hours on the phone with Comcast. I don&#8217;t even want to talk about it, I&#8217;m so irritated. But I&#8217;m back, which is nice. And now I can catch up on email.

Work is going well. Yay.

I saw _Anchorman_ tonight. It&#8217;s probably the funniest movie I&#8217;ve seen all year. Seriously, a good time. Check it out.
