  - "What show, if any, is the heir apparent for Seinfeld? Some postulate it is How I Met Your Mother. I argue that It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia more completely espouses the spirit of the seminal NBC sitcom of the 90s."

If you know me at all, you know that I consider _<a class="zem_slink" title="Seinfeld" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/">Seinfeld</a>_ to be one of the most essential and influential sitcoms of all time. Plus, I think it&#8217;s totally hilarious, and even though I&#8217;ve seen every episode at least four times, I still have my DVR record it.

Therefore, today, when my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/heysuburban" target="_blank">@heysuburban</a> posted the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/heysuburban/status/28608926274" target="_blank">following tweet</a>, my interest was piqued.

My initial response was to suggest that I consider _It&#8217;s <a class="zem_slink" title="It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472954/">Always Sunny In Philadelphia</a>_ to be much more the heir apparent of _Seinfeld_&#8230;however, @heysuburban did (accurately) comment that _How I Met Your Mother_ espouses the &#8220;episodes about nothing&#8221; motif originated by _Seinfeld_.

Ultimately, it goes back to the question of &#8220;what defines _Seinfeld_?&#8221; In my 2005 essay, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/40025223/Essay2-Seinfeld" target="_blank">&#8220;Latex Salesmen and Magic Loogies&#8221;</a>, I postulated that the three defining characteristics of the show were &#8220;pop culture references, idiosyncratic analysis of the mundane details of everyday life, and misanthropic behavior.&#8221; If we agree with this list (and you had best agree, since I&#8217;m super smart), then _<a class="zem_slink" title="How I Met Your Mother" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460649/">HIMYM</a>_ really only inherits the first and second items in the list&#8230;but not the third. Sure, Barney is kind of a giant d-bag towards women, but overall, he&#8217;s NOT a _Seinfeld_ level d-bag.

Those guys live in Philadelphia.

To be fair, _Sunny_ doesn&#8217;t really hit for the other areas, though. It&#8217;s not very pop-culture oriented (although that seems to be really a factor of ALL modern sitcoms today, as opposed to during _Seinfeld_&#8216;s run) and it definitely does not have the minutiae investigation. But when it comes to the vicariously enjoyable behavior of characters who are, deep down, terrible human beings, nobody does it like _Sunny_ &#8211; with the possible exception of _<a class="zem_slink" title="Curb Your Enthusiasm" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264235/">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>_, but that&#8217;s not really fair, is it?

Speaking of _Curb_, one phenomenon I have observed is that, surprisingly, being a _Seinfeld_ fan does not always guarantee that someone enjoys _Curb_. What I have seen is that the deciding factor is WHY the person loved _Seinfeld_. Folks who predominately enjoyed _Seinfeld_ for the &#8220;Seinlanguage&#8221; aspects (&#8220;regifter&#8221;, &#8220;close-talker&#8221;, etc) tend to violently dislike _Curb_ (these people also generally consider Kramer or Jerry their favorite characters). However, _Seinfeld_ fans who loved the anti-social behavior of the characters (and who exhibit a preference for George or Elaine) find _Curb_ to be a perfectly natural progression of their favorite characters. I also find that these people enjoy shows like _Sunny_ or _The Office_, whereas the first grouping tend to find those shows tedious or offensive/insulting.

What are your thoughts on the topic? What show (if any) carries the mantle of the Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer?
